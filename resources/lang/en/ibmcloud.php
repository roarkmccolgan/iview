            Welcome to the "journey to cloud" assessment tool. As you progress along your cloud transformation journey, it will be good to take stock and see how far you have come. The first step on the cloud journey is to move applications and data into the cloud; the second step is to build your own cloud-native applications or enhance existing ones; and the third step is to manage a portfolio of multiple cloud services efficiently and set up a cloud operating model.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            This assessment will tell you how far you have progressed and what the next steps are on your journey in three categories — <span class="text-ibm-blue">"Move,"</span> <span class="text-ibm-blue">"Build,"</span> and <span class="text-ibm-blue">"Manage."</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            At the end of the assessment, you will receive a customized IDC report showing how you scored, where your strengths are, and which areas require more focus.

            <p class="mb-2">
                Building a hybrid and multicloud-based digital platform for application modernization is a key step in digital transformation because older infrastructure approaches and applications do not provide the agility and adaptability necessary for today\'s business environment and customer expectations. Moving applications into a <strong class="text-gray-800">cloud environment</strong>, be it private or public cloud, is an important step in <strong class="text-gray-800">application modernization</strong>. There are different strategies for application modernization that make sense for different applications. The maturity stage for this dimension is dependent on the cloud deployment model used, the chosen cloud migration strategy, and the motivation for modernizing applications.

            <p class="mb-2">
                Digital transformation is mainly done through <strong class="text-gray-800">digitizing business processes</strong> and supporting them with digital <strong class="text-gray-800">applications developed in the cloud</strong>. Many innovative services are also provided from the cloud first and developers are using cloud-native tools and processes.
