        <p class="mb-2">
            Cloud adoption is critical for successful IT modernization to support digital transformation initiatives. Competing in the global economy for customers, investment, and talent requires instant access to relevant data and IT resources that don\'t compromise on speed, scale, security, or costs. A well-thought-out cloud Journey and consistent execution of this Journey delivers the flexibility and scale that underpins digital business success and data transformation.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        To assess cloud adoption maturity, IDC has developed a Cloud Journey Assessment tool to understand digital business ambitions, cloud strategies, and execution challenges. Based on the results, we have grouped the respondents into three categories — <strong>Cloud Starter, Cloud Practitioner, and Cloud Master</strong> - to understand what sets the masters apart from their competitors and which best practices we can learn from them in making the cloud and data transformation journey successful.

            The key priorities for organizations accelerating their digital transformation journeys are IT modernization, successful cloud adoption, and progress in becoming data-driven. They want to use cloud and data transformation initiatives to improve efficiency, business performance, and the speed of innovation. Delivering on digital business mandates requires a well-thought-out cloud Journey and set of technologies to drive innovation, all without compromising on cost control, security, or regulatory obligations. Providing a flexible IT delivery model and relevant data at speed, while aligning with business needs, is critical. Developing a successful cloud and data Journey will form the bedrock on which to digitally transform your organization in a scaleable and agile manner.

        <p class="italic mb-1 text-blue-dark">
            The key to successful digital transformation is the ability to make IT a business enabler by leveraging cloud and business data. The better an organization is in its vision, execution and overcoming challenges along the way, the higher they are in the maturity curve giving them a competitive differentiation.

                Focusing on cost savings as the key driver for cloud migration and application modernization efforts might initially seem like the most sensible approach … but is it? Early stage cloud adoption was often driven by the expectation to save costs when moving from a capex model on-premises to an opex model in the cloud. However, the business case in the cloud does not stack up if you are not also changing your processes so that you scale your application usage up and down according to demand. In addition, cloud as an operating model provides so many other benefits like access to innovative services and support of an agile working culture, which provide more significant advantages than "only" cost savings. To get to the next level, you should think more broadly about the benefits that a cloud and application modernization Journey can provide for your organization.

                Cloud is a great way to drive operational efficiency at the infrastructure layer, as the cloud provider manages the infrastructure for you so you can free up IT infrastructure operations staff and focus them on other tasks. However, the move to the cloud requires new skills as well, so you need to retrain your staff with cloud management capabilities or look to external resources to fill the gaps. In addition, please consider that cloud offers much more than operational efficiency and is the foundation for digital transformation. To move to the next level of cloud maturity, you might want to investigate how you can use the cloud for business model innovation and transformation, for example by opening up your data and driving new revenue streams from your data in a compliant way.

                When you find that your competitors are moving to the cloud, it is an opportune moment to investigate if cloud could make sense for your organization as well. Once your competitors and even potential disruptors from outside your industry are using cloud services, they might leapfrog your organization thanks to the operational benefits and the greater innovative potential that cloud provides. To progress to the next level of cloud maturity, you should not only investigate the use of cloud as a defensive move, but really open up to the transformational potential that cloud brings and find out how you can build new products and services based on the functionality that cloud provides.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Cloud is the launchpad for digital transformation, with 69% of organizations operating a multicloud environment today, according to IDC\'s 2019 Multicloud Survey. Given the advancements in cloud solutions and the importance of security, resilience, cost transparency, and compliance, cloud adoption is more nuanced today. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Successful enterprises are committed to enterprisewide IT transformation in a sustainable and compliant way, making multicloud and hybrid cloud a natural evolution. How they navigate through the multicloud complexities and develop unified monitoring, workflow management, cost management, and compliance determines their multicloud success. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The realization is dawning among savvy enterprises that there is no "silver bullet cloud" that answers all IT issues. Organizations therefore seek to build an interoperable, hybrid, and multicloud IT infrastructure to gain the benefit of cloud without compromising on core IT values of security, resilience, and compliance. Cloud is seen as an operating model rather than a destination.

                Your IT environment still represents a traditional IT environment that is mostly reactive to business needs. As business needs change rapidly, there is a risk that the business views IT as a scapegoat and an inhibitor rather than a business enabler. Traditional on-premises IT is complex, hardware-driven, monolithic, and slow to respond to agile business needs. Traditional IT also forces business to adopt shadow IT practices and renders traditional security policies inadequate, exposing the business to risks.

                Your IT environment still represents a traditional IT environment that is mostly reactive to business needs. As business needs change rapidly, there is a risk that the business views IT as a scapegoat and an inhibitor rather than a business enabler. Traditional on-premises IT is complex, hardware-driven, monolithic, and slow to respond to agile business needs. Traditional IT also forces business to adopt shadow IT practices and renders traditional security policies inadequate, exposing the business to risks. You need to strategize an IT modernization plan, using cloud to progress in your business transformation.
