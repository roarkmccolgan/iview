                The ultimate state of a hybrid multicloud platform is one that supports existing business processes and enables innovation. It leverages cloud-native technologies like containers, micro services and APIs, spans multiple clouds and allows for fast services deployments and secure and efficient provisioning of resources.

            <p class="mb-2">
                The hybrid multicloud platform is based on open standards so that applications can seamlessly move between on-premises and public cloud environments, depending on cost, performance and regulatory compliance requirements.

            <p class="mb-2">
                Optimal use of cloud however, is more comprehensive than establishing a platform of modern technologies. Organisational structures and competencies must revolve around cloud, an application modernisation road map need to be in place, and application development processes must be agile to take advantage of the opportunities a hybrid multicloud platform provides.

            <h3 class="text-ibm-blue mb-2">Move</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Building a hybrid and multicloud-based digital platform for application modernization is a key step in digital transformation, because older infrastructure approaches and applications do not provide the agility and adaptability necessary for today\'s business environment and customer expectations. Moving applications into a cloud environment, be it private or public cloud, is an important step in application modernization. There are different strategies for application modernization that make sense for different applications. The maturity stage for this dimension is dependent on the cloud deployment model used, the chosen cloud migration strategy, and the motivation for modernizing applications.

            </p>
            <h3 class="text-ibm-blue mb-2">Build</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Digital transformation is mainly done through digitizing business processes and supporting them with digital applications developed in the cloud. Many innovative services are also provided from the cloud first and developers are using cloud-native tools and processes. The maturity stage for this dimension is dependent on tools and processes used for cloud-native application development
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-ibm-blue mb-2">Manage</h3>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Running workloads in a cloud environment is a dynamic discipline. New services are continuously deployed, and new functionalities are made available by vendors. Moreover, prices fluctuate, regulations change, and IT security threats constantly evolve, making it essential to persistently shift workloads to the most applicable platform. The maturity stage for this dimension is dependent on the tools and processes in place as well as the motivation driving the orchestration.

                To stay ahead of the competition, you need to constantly keep up to date with the new technologies and services made available from the cloud as the cloud platform evolves from virtual machines, to containers, to functions. Application architectures need to evolve accordingly so that you can adapt quickly to new technology and market developments. Your application modernization strategies need to be related to your business strategy and drive business outcomes.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Digital transformation is mainly achieved by building highly scalable digital applications in the cloud and supporting them with digitized business processes. Modern applications built in the cloud can leverage the benefits of the cloud to then capitalize on other innovative technologies such as AI, cognitive, next-gen security, IoT, and so on to become more intuitive, dynamic, and responsive. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Many innovative services and digital features are also provided first from the cloud, and developers using cloud-native tools and processes to build modern applications can leverage these new features early on to build a competitive advantage.

                <p class="my-4 italic font-base text-black px-4 py-2 bg-grey-light">
                    By 2021, 70% of new enterprise applications will be developed cloud-native, leveraging cloud, containers, microservices architectures, and DevOps methodologies.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Mastering this dimension and becoming a cloud innovator means you have the infrastructure, skills, and processes needed to build cloud-native applications at the speed and scale that the business demands. You can also access and experiment with new digital technologies and features released in the cloud and build considerable competitive advantage. IDC estimates that by 2025, about two-thirds of European organizations will become prolific software producers, and your maturity in cloud development will help you to claim a strong stake in the ground in the future.
