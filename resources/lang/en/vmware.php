        <h2 class="text-vmware-blue mb-4">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Thank you for completing the VMware Secure-by-Design Network Advisor, with research and analysis by IDC. As organizations embrace digital transformation and adopt new practices such as cloud, SaaS, and IoT, it is very difficult to effectively secure their IT estate with a perimeter-based solution alone. Indeed, the sheer scale and changing nature of the threat environment mean that security breaches will happen â€” and this requires a new posture on security: one that is focused on near-real-time breach detection, containment, and mitigation.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Enterprise networks play a critical role in enabling this new security posture. New networking tools such as software-defined networking, microsegmentation, and advanced monitoring enable end-to-end visibility across the entire infrastructure and into the cloud. However, moving from an existing network state to an intelligent, secure-by-design network requires careful planning and execution.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">To help organizations assess their network maturity and benchmark against peers, IDC has developed the Secure-by-Design Network Advisor Tool. This interactive self-assessment tool is built on IDC\'s in-depth understanding of enterprise networking and security markets.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The Secure-by-Design Network Advisor Tool uses a comparison framework which groups organizations into three levels of maturity, based on their approach to: </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
            Organizations can only effectively secure their IT estate in the era of digital transformation if this goes hand in hand with an evolution of their network. IDC has created the Secure-by-Design Network Advisor Tool to help organizations assess the ability of their network to deliver security by design. It scores organizations on their approach to network infrastructure, operations, and security. Based on individual responses we class organizations into three levels of maturity: Followers, Generalists, and Leaders.

Before investigating how visibility of the security situation underpins all other efforts to engage with the business, you should focus on taking the rest of your network to a higher level.

                Digital transformation is changing the cybersecurity landscape and exposing enterprises to more threats than ever before. A new approach to security is required, and with new networking tools enabling greater visibility, threat detection, and mitigation, the enterprise network is becoming an essential part of organizations\' security strategy.

                To deliver this new security posture you need to develop a strategic road map for network evolution that demonstrates the role new networking tools can play in delivering security by design. Assess the current status of your network, and where you want it to be in the future. Prepare a gradual migration path that leverages the existing infrastructure where possible. Software-defined networking, centralized policy controls, and automation should feature prominently in this road map.

                As a Network Follower, you need to develop a more strategic approach to purchasing and operating network equipment. This should involve taking a more proactive approach to adopting new networking tools and equipment, rather than running kit until it fails, and experimenting with intelligent networking products that can centralize, virtualize, and eventually automate more of your network operation processes. These new tools will enable you to adopt a more advanced security posture, based on the assumption that breaches are inevitable, rather than relying on the outdated perimeter-based model.

                As a Network Generalist you already view your network as an important asset and take a strategic approach to purchasing and operating your network. To become a Network Leader you need to develop a road map to migrate from legacy network equipment to software-defined, virtualized network solutions. These will enable you to upgrade your network functions and security through software updates, and provide enhanced visibility across your ICT estate.

                As a Network Leader you understand how critical your enterprise network is for delivering digital transformation. You are already using software-defined networking and analytics tools to improve your network operations and security. To build on this, you need to make sure your network and security teams work closely together and have the right skills to operate increasingly virtualized networks. This will take investment in people, tools, and training, and it is a multiyear journey.
