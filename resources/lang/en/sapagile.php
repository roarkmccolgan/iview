                            <li class="mb-2">Look at your standard measures and metrics, such as revenue, profit, and productivity. These are critical to provide an overview of the business, but they show a picture of past performance, rather than what will happen in the future. Businesses with much more agile strategic planning tend to use things like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to show the direction of travel for their business. By looking at these, you may be able to better steer your organization towards sources of growth and away from declining markets, for example. </li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Also look to invest in technologies that help you measure changes happening to the business in real time. Don\'t wait for weekly or monthly figures on marketing or sales activity. Look at patterns in sales over seasons or based on changes to products or deliveries, etc. These can be very effective data points to keep the strategy up-to-date and ensure everyone is aligned across different business functions. </li>

                            At this stage, most organizations have streamlined and standardized their business processes, but the speed of change in the digital economy requires business processes that can continuously adapt.

                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Here are some ideas to help drive agility in processes within your organization:

                        <ol class="pl-6 text-sap-blue">
                            <li class="mb-2">The first step towards adaptability is automation. This releases people from repetitive tasks to focus on higher value activities. Look at the processes within your organization that could be automated or at the very least streamlined. This will enable people to work on value-adding activities, such as customer engagement, innovation, or improvements. The business will also become much more adaptable to changes. In short, agility leads to even better ways of dealing with change.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Evaluate how you can automate processes to improve the flow of information across the business. Making certain processes more digital means you can capture data that may lead to even more improvements. Things you didn\'t know were problems become obvious and you can address them more easily. Similarly, you can spot opportunities better and act on them.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Develop process charts that could help you understand performance against certain key metrics (measurement of the business). Better still, make these charts visual, so people can see patterns and understand them more easily. This could be things like delivery times, or the delays caused by failures in processes. Share these measurements with the wider business, including all employees, not just management.</li>

Ensure that this data is not held within each of the business silos (operations, sales, marketing, distribution, etc.) but communicated across the business to be used by everyone.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Explore the use of machine learning algorithms that analyze these data sets and provide next best actions in your various business processes. This may seem like a giant leap, but many technology partners will be able to provide this as a proof of concept for you to explore. Focus on one or two parts of the business and see what impact this can have. </li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Develop process visualization charts (ways of providing visual representations of the processes happening in your business).

                            Typically, organizations at this stage already have a central database of customer insight and they use it to make changes to the business based on evolving customer needs. Next, you need to be able to start responding to customer requirements as they happen. Or as IDC terms it, in real time.

                            <li class="mb-2">In order to align the organization to respond to customer needs faster, IDC recommends that new measures should be adopted across the organization. These include things like Net Promoter Score (NPS). This is a way of assessing if a customer would recommend your business to other people. This will set a new focus on delivering and exceeding customer expectations and enable you to collect more insight on what is happening, in order to make improvements.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Customer agility also demands that you create cross-domain teams that are focused on customer outcomes and improving customer experience and loyalty. Areas of the business that feel they are not customer-facing need to become part of that process and understand that they can impact the customer experience through their own actions. This will also engage employees in their work.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Create dynamic dashboards surfacing key insights on the top customer trends. Communicate these trends across the wider business (and where possible to suppliers and distributors). Gather feedback and ideas on where your business can take advantage of this insight. </li>

                            Organizations at this stage typically have very transactional relationships with their suppliers and distributors. As a result, changes made with suppliers often take time to implement and cooperation is focused more on the contract, rather than on providing feedback and finding flexibility. Similarly, relationships with distributors are about providing what they demand or telling them what you have, rather than working with them in a form of partnership.

                            A common feature is that while speed of change is helped by frequent review points, reacting to this can still be slow. As a result, change may be based on what has happened, rather than on anticipating market dynamics in the future.

                            <li class="mb-2">Think about how you can make roles and functions more flexible. This shows employees that they can move about the business, creating much better integration of knowledge, as well as resulting in better employee retention.</li>
