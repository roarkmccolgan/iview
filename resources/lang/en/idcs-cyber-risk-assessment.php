            Running your enterprise in the 21st century is akin to swimming with sharks. The danger is clear: threat actors are becoming more potent, more organized and more collaborative by the day. Yet you need to swim in the ocean of Digital Transformation, which is becoming a mission critical concern for today’s CEO. However, it also means swimming deeper into the shark infested waters. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital transformation technologies – big data/analytics, cloud computing, mobility and social business – take corporate applications and data outside the safety of perimeter controls at the endpoint and the network. This represents a loss of visibility and control for security professionals. Not only are you swimming through murky waters, but the door to that shark-proof cage that used to protect you has swung open!
        </p>
        <p>
            Avoiding digital transformation is not an option. One need only consider the fate of enterprises such as Blockbusters and Borders that have failed to adapt to the new reality to understand the implications. Instead, a step change in both technological approach and strategic mindset are required. This report aims to uncover best practice exhibited by your peers with the most mature approach towards security. In order to swim with the sharks, and maybe even bite back, a new outlook is required.
        </p>
        <h4>Using this Report</h4>
        <p>
            This report aims to provide you with insights into the characteristics and progression of maturity in security. It identifies examples of best practice that you can aspire to in order to improve your security maturity. It also highlights innovation accelerators that have a particularly strong impact on boosting maturity levels. Finally, it offers recommendations for how you can improve your position in comparison with your peers. These insights emerge from a survey of 500 senior security decision-makers based in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.
        </p>
        <h4>Your peers’ Maturity Profile</h4>
        <img class="pull-right" src="/images/tools/2/firgure1.jpg">
        <p>
            Based on our survey of 500 senior security decision-makers, IDC has broken the market down into five categories of maturity. From low to high, these are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ad-hoc</li>
            <li>opportunistic</li>
            <li>repeatable</li>
            <li>managed</li>
            <li>optimized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Enterprises are typically distributed into a classic ‘bell curve’ as shown in figure 1:
        </p>
        <p>
            There are very few of your peer organizations at the low end in their approach towards security, and also few at the top end. Instead, the majority of peer enterprises sit somewhere in the middle. If you aim to swim with sharks without getting bitten, you should aspire beyond parity of your peers and embrace best practice. The next section of this report gives indication of what best practice in security looks like.
        </p>
        <h4>Security Best Practice</h4>
        <p>
            Traditionally, security technology has aimed to protect enterprises from known threats. By gathering devices, applications and data behind the safety net of the firewall, perimeter controls at the device and network levels could keep those known threats at bay. However, such preventative security models are being rendered insufficient as a stand-alone approach by two trends:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital transformation is taking corporate applications and data beyond the perimeter, and outside the visibility and control of in-house security teams.</li>
            <li>The sheer scale of threats is unprecedented. The number of new malware variants emerging on a daily basis is over a million. It is simply impossible to generate signatures at a rapid enough pace to maintain traditional defenses that aim to block new threats.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Quite clearly, new approaches are required that will help enterprises to identify and respond to unknown threats as well as blocking out known threats. Security must become proactive, seeking potential indicators of compromise to remediate rather than waiting for an attack to become evident. However, this requires a mental leap in security strategy. An analysis of what is considered to be limiting security effectiveness across the maturity levels is enlightening, as shown in figure 2 below:
        </p>
        <img class="pull-right" src="/images/tools/2/firgure2.jpg">
        <p>
            There are certain common themes that apply across all maturity levels. Specifically, cost and skills availability are the primary limitations. This is no surprise given the global skills shortage that endures within the security market. However, it is the degree to which further concerns are considered where an insight into best practice emerges.
        </p>
        <p>
            For lower level maturities, cost pressures and skills shortages are the overwhelming concerns. But at more mature levels, there is a greater balance between these areas and areas such as the management of conflicting priorities and supporting demand for new business services. This highlights a key step change in mentality: best practice in security is to consider the needs of the business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once this mental leap has been made, enterprises must consider what this means in terms of practical security approaches. In particular, the progression away from reactive security models towards proactive security is required. In fact, as shown in figure 3 below, there are two clear trends across maturity techniques. The more mature an enterprise is, the less likely it is to not be using proactive security techniques, and more likely to either be planning or already using them.
        </p>
        <img class="pull-right" src="/images/tools/2/firgure3.jpg">
        <p>
            According to our survey, key security technologies that enterprises can adopt in order to facilitate these more proactive approaches include threat intelligence, artificial intelligence and heuristic analysis of user behavior. As with proactive technologies, the more mature an enterprise’s security approach is, the more likely it is to make use of solutions such as AI and heuristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although proactive security approaches represent an opportunity to move up the security maturity scale, they also bring their own challenges. For example, proactive techniques require the gathering and monitoring of operational and behavioral logs on a far larger scale. Given the pressures on both financial resources that security teams are facing, a grown up discussion of techniques to help lighten the load on internal resources is required.  Best practice indicates that there are two potential outlets.

                Service providers at this stage are very much at the beginning of their cloud journey. They are yet to embrace a cloud future and as a result see little profitability in this area. Many choose to pass on cloud opportunities to their vendor partners, or at best limit themselves to reselling the most common types of public cloud services. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Without specific revenue targets for cloud, service providers have no way of measuring cloud success and lack any direction in developing this part of their business further. Marketing and sales functions are very much based on transactional business models (hardware and software license sales) and lack the sophistication of line of business and vertical targeting to generate any successful cloud demand. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Partners taking this passive approach must make a decision to either embrace cloud as a fundamental direction for their business, or find themselves fighting for survival faster than they realize.

            <p>
                Service providers at this stage in their journey are beginning to develop cloud business models and programs, but are primarily reselling cloud vendor solutions with very little intellectual property of their own. Many have yet to define a longer-term strategy for cloud and run the cloud elements of their business as a separate function and product line, often with separate targets.
            </p>
            <p>
                While some elements of modernization of the portfolio are taking place, investments in this area may be limited. As a result, customer renewals, repeat, or even linked business development may be lost, undermining the future success of cloud. Sales and marketing are beginning to build a team of cloud specialists, but commission structures are still based on first year subscriptions or license fees rather than on recurring revenues and renewals. This tentative approach to cloud places many service providers in an uncertain and strategically vulnerable position.
            </p>
            <p>
                They need to embrace cloud and throw the whole business behind it.

        'stage3'=>'
            <p>
                Service providers at this stage of their cloud maturity have tipped the scale in favor of cloud models. Many have invested heavily in cloud technologies as part of a longer-term strategy and are beginning to convert project-based opportunities into recurring revenue contracts. This has resulted in the creation of a dedicated P&L structure for cloud, measured through cloud-specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and with sales personnel carrying fixed top-line cloud targets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Service providers at this stage have begun to integrate cloud into all sales team portfolios and as a result they have launched their business down a path of which they must be certain. Despite this, the majority of the revenue is still generated by traditional offerings, with cloud offerings bringing the additional boost.
            </p>
            <p>
                They must push on and not turn back.

            <p>
                Cloud service providers at this stage in their maturity are delivering established cloud services through dedicated sales, implementation, and support functions. This enables the service provider to pursue defined cloud revenue and profitability targets, and to continue operating long-term investment decisions based on predictable and sizeable recurring cloud revenues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond cloud, service providers at this level are also delivering high-margin professional services, extending relationships with customers, and refining the business to focus on specific verticals and business processes. Cloud is integrated into all sales team portfolios, utilizing sophisticated presales support activities and delivering well-qualified and progressed sales leads. At this level of maturity, the architecture offered is typically multiform (private hosted, private on customer premise, or multitenant).
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, cloud service providers are in the process of refinement. This is true of their offering and routes to market, as well as their delivery, development, and investment strategy. Critically, this is about refining the business model and approach to profitability — areas that require continued commitment.

            <p>
                Cloud service providers at this stage in their maturity have a well established cloud business, in many cases including hybrid cloud capabilities and solutions via partnerships with multiple vendors. Cloud underpins all investment in the business across people, infrastructure, and partnerships. More to the point, cloud investments are made on a much longer-term basis, primarily with longer-term profitability as a vision, something which is now being realized.
            </p>
            <p>
                The organization is also committed to a recurring revenue business model, fueling growth and further specialization of the organization and its capabilities. All aspects of the business are focused on a broad set of KPIs, from customer adoption and growth targets, to satisfaction levels. In addition, professional services play a key role in both business targets and the delivery of cloud solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Service providers are in a position to offer any form of cloud architecture to customers and must ensure that the expertise and intellectual property generated in this process is maximized in full. As a result, service providers in this category are already moving at full speed. Now, they must look to maximize their leadership position and drive long-term profitability.

            <p>
                Cloud service providers at this stage in their cloud strategy maturity do not have a defined plan or financial target for cloud. In most cases they are reacting on a piecemeal basis to demand for cloud from their existing customer base and as such do not have established measures in place for cloud success. Cloud either isn\'t a part of the wider business portfolio, or is merely of a subset of other business resources. Service providers at this stage in their cloud strategy are yet to fully embrace a cloud future and as a result may struggle to generate profits in this area.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> You should study the market opportunity, observe your competitors, and present the case for cloud. You need to select which parts of the cloud service space you want to cover — and invest. Start with a narrow focus area close to your key expertise (e.g., implementation services around OpenStack if you are primarily a system integrator) and reap early success. Executive sponsorship and support is necessary to advance to the next stages, and your senior leadership need to start the process of defining a vision and establishing a core leadership team.

            <p>
                Cloud service providers at this stage in their maturity are in the process of building a defined cloud strategy. For many, however, this remains focused on private cloud solutions, predominantly on-premise. Typically, service providers at this stage are yet to define a longer-term investment plan for cloud, but have focused the business on recurring revenue growth goals, even if this is without separate targets for cloud. Structurally, the cloud business runs as a separate product line and is managed as such. Cloud revenue targets do exist, but these tend to be "soft."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Set up clear numerical targets for both core cloud services and adjacent services. Make sure that these are recognized within the organization. If you have not done so yet, celebrate early wins in your core expertise areas for cloud, and set a business plan for expanding those. You should also at this stage build a detailed investment plan which factors in growth, revenue, and, critically, profitability. It is recommended at this stage to seek guidance and create financial models exploring the potential impact of recurring revenue on your profitability.

            <p>
                Cloud service providers at this stage of their cloud maturity are building a defined strategy including private and public cloud solutions. As a result, they have also created a clear cloud business plan, with dedicated targets for the next two to three years. They are also operating their cloud business within a specific P&L structure, also incorporating cloud-specific metrics and KPIs to measure performance in this area. To support this, sales personnel carry fixed top-line targets for cloud. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Start segmenting customers based on their projected lifetime value. You should be investing in areas that will drive next-wave cloud adoption (e.g., DevOps and PaaS) while continuing to fuel the first wave. Share your cloud strategy and vision with key strategic vendors and start building in processes to conduct joint planning and regular performance reviews. Their support could significantly help you along your journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also recommended that you adopt and actively use cloud technologies across your own business, and many successful cloud service providers use cloud internally. This will not only familiarize the entire organization with cloud, but also develop best practices and intellectual property (IP), which can be commercialized and sold to customers.

                Cloud service providers at this stage of maturity have a defined and established cloud strategy in place and a firm idea of where this is taking the business. Cloud has become core to the business and forms the basis of overall investment decisions and forward planning. Services are priced on the basis of recurring revenues, but more importantly on the lifetime value of the customer. As a result, processes are in place to reduce churn and drive cloud profitability longer term. Dedicated presales, sales, and support functions deliver cloud solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Look at expanding your set of hybrid offerings, as well as bolstering investment in datacenter or network infrastructure to achieve competitive advantage. If you have vertical-specific cloud packages, think about how they could be leveraged in other sectors. It would also be advantageous to begin "verticalizing" your execution strategies. In other words, building execution and go-to-market strategies to target specific industries, while associating the solutions, sales resources, and marketing collateral to support this.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are active in the application space, plan to systematically migrate your customer\'s on-premise applications to a subscription-based model delivered from your cloud infrastructure. Build a future-looking technical strategy, led by an innovation team, which focuses on developing solutions and reference architectures that have the potential to be reused and even commercialized as standalone products.

                Cloud providers at this stage have well established cloud businesses, delivering private and public cloud solutions via partnerships with multiple vendors. In most of the cases this includes hybrid cloud capabilities and the technology skill-set that enables this, but there are examples of advanced cloud strategies founded exclusively on delivering a set of standard SaaS/IaaS/PaaS services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Critically, cloud underpins all investment in the business across people, infrastructure, and partnerships, and each is made on a longer-term basis. Systems have been created to optimize cloud profitability through recurring revenue services and cloud is no longer a separate business with its own P&L. Cloud now forms the architecture of all solutions and sales focus.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> You are on a good trajectory. It might now be the time to invest some of those profits back into perfecting the customer experience with features such as consolidated billing or a customer portal. Strategically, you should look at partnering or buying with vertical-specific ISVs. This will enable you to chase new opportunities and leverage new demand for cloud coming from Innovation Accelerators such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence. You must also look to develop, refine, and sell your own IP to your existing and potential customer base, and this approach will help define and evolve your future execution and planning strategies.

                At this stage of maturity, your competition will be fierce, as well as sophisticated. It is now critical to differentiate through solutions that provide business value to your clients by directly addressing and solving business issues. This solution-driven culture should be embedded across all business units — sales, marketing, operations, and technical, with the resources to support this it.

                Cloud service providers at this stage in their process and skill-set maturity are often reacting to customer demand and typically develop each cloud solution on a project-by-project basis. They are yet to develop tools or reusable methodologies to support this emerging element of their business. As a result, monitoring tools are limited in their existence and usage and support is delivered on a reactive basis through a generic call center environment. Most will not be in a position to offer systems integration services for cloud at this stage in their journey.

                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> To migrate your maturity in processes and skill-sets, you need to understand your short-term, mid-term, and longer-term skill requirements for cloud. Look to vendors to help achieve this, enabling you to build a training plan by individual department (technical, marketing, sales). You can start by creating a fulcrum of knowledge by hiring cloud architects and technical experts from competitors or vendors, then training your own engineers around these assets.

As your cloud business starts to scale, you will need reusable cloud methodologies and the ability to deliver mechanisms that ensure profitable delivery. You should also start testing and trialing automation tools while the business is still small enough to manage without automation.

                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Take a look at your certification list and select two key focus areas for the next 12 months. These should be in areas such as cloud automation, orchestration, or PaaS platforms. Start planning for certification paths (e.g., ISO) to ensure large customers are satisfied. As you evolve to the next stage of maturity it will become necessary to obtain vendor certifications and training targets. This will not only help build up the capabilities you need to advance the cloud business, but also help you progress through to the next tiers with your strategic cloud vendor partners. The creation of reusable processes is a longer-term goal, with systems, methodologies, and KPIs designed to optimize cloud profitability through high-margin recurring revenues.

            <p>
                Cloud service providers at this stage in their process and skill-set maturity have established their cloud business enough to reuse cloud implementation procedures and methodologies. As part of a managed service offering, they are also able to deliver analytics and advice on cloud optimization. For many, the sophistication of their systems integration capability enables them to deploy cloud and hybrid cloud, based on a range of vendor partner solutions. Rather than reacting to faults and customer demand, support is proactive and partner driven, alerting customers through a communication platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> To progress, you need to invest in skills for hybrid cloud management software and scripting expertise. This means filling in all of the remaining gaps in certifications, both at quality assurance level as well as datacenter facility level. You must also enhance your customer support efforts by setting up proactive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

                Automation and measurement metrics should be introduced across the organization and externally to the customer site. This includes understanding how customers utilize cloud solutions, which solutions are optimized, and assessing trends and patterns which could potentially be replicated to other customers. You should also start trialing and testing analytics tools across core business functions (sales, delivery, operations, and marketing). These will become a key differentiator as your cloud business matures.

                Cloud service providers at this stage in their maturity have created processes and skills around a set of reusable best practices, methodologies, and tools. This includes reference architecture and code, which can be customized and modified for clients, on a multitenant basis. This reduces both implementation times and speed to value. Automation and predictive services are a central feature of managed service delivery, along with sophisticated tools that enable one-to-many repeatable managed services. Support is preemptive and is delivered through an integrated communications platform.

                Cloud service providers at this stage have created and refined cloud automation. This reduces time to implement cloud services, driving customer satisfaction, utilization, and ultimately service provider profitability. Managed services are being delivered, many of which have deep levels of analytical capability, enabling automation and the creation of highly developed toolsets that underpin cloud solutions. SI work has reached a level of sophistication that IP has been created and solidified, enabling the business to take on larger-scale projects. Support is delivered on a preemptive and proactive basis, not only with deep levels of monitoring and analytics, but also recommendations for improvement.

            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Measurement and automation are constantly evolving. Your systems and services need to work at scale, and enable further specialization and higher levels of process automation. This reduces time to complete projects, generating greater profitability and growth. Organizations at this stage need to place greater emphasis on scalability, ensuring that the business is able to fulfil opportunities and maximize its wider capabilities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Automation should be applied to all business functions, enabling your organization to monitor usage, optimize customer utilization and cloud service delivery, and streamline and maximize sales processes. At this stage, you should be building capabilities to support broader digital transformation objectives. This includes areas such as digital, integration, and business process. Building deeper specialization with strategic vendors is also recommended as you look to differentiate through innovative solutions.

            <p>
                At this stage of maturity, service providers are yet to make significant investments in cloud and are not able to progress beyond basic resell and referral. They do not have the capability to manage complex hybrid environments, and are far away from additional value-adds such as unified billing, management, and security. Cloud is generally delivered on an ad hoc, reactive basis and there is a reliance on support from vendor partners. Equally, skills and tools in the PaaS or developer platform service areas are likely to be minimal, if at all present. Providers at this stage may offer dedicated or internal storage hosting to their existing client base, but rarely have datacenter capabilities; the most common scenario is simply renting capacity in a single co-location site. Based on the level of overall maturity, cloud solutions are being billed on a project or annual basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> As your cloud business gains momentum, your value proposition to your customers and competitive differentiation will be affected by your ability to offer value-added features. This will require investment in your own delivery capabilities. It is advisable at this stage to associate your business planning with a technology investment plan for each stage of your cloud maturity. The first step should be a thorough assessment of your server virtualization platforms and a stress test of your storage back-end. Only with those in place can offerings around private hosted cloud be developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Look at your cloud vendor partners, and prioritize those which are most strategic to your future business in terms of alignment with your target market and business mix. Work on a plan with these strategic vendors to enroll or progress to the next tier in their cloud partner programs and get advice on what infrastructure investments you should be making to optimize delivery.

            </ul>
            <p>
                At this stage of maturity organizations have made some investments in cloud infrastructure, tools, and management technologies. Virtualization is under their belt and they are preparing a roadmap for both the technology and skills requirements necessary to build a cloud business. Typically, organizations at this stage are able to offer hosted private cloud solutions, as well as hosted services such as email, backup, and file sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, managed services around traditional SQL database environments are offered. However, proper PaaS offerings are still typically a few steps away. The maturity of their storage capability enables organizations at this stage to offer SAN and NAS environments, as well as traditional external storage. Cloud orchestration tools that pull together storage, network, and compute resources are being explored, but rarely in production environments. Billing is mainly delivered annually, but many organizations are starting to develop the capability to bill monthly, based on consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Organizations at this stage must focus on investments that enable scalable cloud infrastructure, as well as tools to support efficient delivery of services. These include proactive managed services, orchestration, and hybrid management capabilities. Building joint solutions should be a key topic of discussion with strategic vendors. Now is the time to create a long-term plan for co-location sourcing, as well as the commitment to invest in your own facilities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Specialization in cloud orchestration tools such as OpenStack is also a logical next step. You should look to analyze past projects and identify technology solutions and services which have the potential to be productized. This will form your own IP. You should also look to your existing account base to identify industries which present specialization opportunities.

                <li>Typically, you have started to offer software-defined storage</li>
                <li>Orchestration tools like OpenStack are also being used </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At this stage, service providers typically have a well structured technology roadmap and continue to invest in tools and management technology. Infrastructure (both IT and facility) and network connectivity skill-sets are solid, with a good track record helping customers both on-premise and in hosted environments. Beyond pure traditional private cloud environments, service providers have started offering first- or third-party multitenant cloud services (IaaS or PaaS). They now have enough tools or scripting capabilities to connect applications across private and public infrastructures. PaaS is appearing on the horizon, but skills are often limited to traditional middleware (e.g., Java).
            </p>
            <p>
                Storage services have become sophisticated enough to begin offering software-defined storage. Cloud orchestration tools like OpenStack are used as the cornerstone for at least some cloud offerings. Monthly billing based on consumption is being implemented, but not real-time spend monitoring. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Priorities should be around developing the support for hybrid environments. This includes more complex front- and back-end flows around unified billing, network optimization, cloud management, and security. You should start building, trialing, and testing cloud automation and management tools. It is also advisable to start exploring alternatives and options for cloud delivery infrastructure, whether that is through a third party or your own datacenter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your customers will start to demand a choice of delivery options (public, private, hybrid) and you will need to have the infrastructure (or agreements) in place. Future solutions, especially around application development platforms and PaaS, should continue to be a key topic of discussion. They should also be incorporated into both joint business planning sessions and technical planning sessions with your strategic vendor partners. Here, the ultimate objective is to start building joint solutions.

                Companies in this stage have typically invested — and continue to invest — in cloud infrastructure, tools, and management technology. They are in the position to offer not only API connectivity between cloud zones, but also manual or planned "bursting" of virtual machine and storage from dedicated to multitenant public environments. The ability to support and integrate multiple environments is a priority, and tools and architecture in hybrid cloud are prioritized. OpenStack skillsets are solid and tested.
            </p>
            <p>
                PaaS offerings (e.g., Red Hat OpenShift) are now typically available to end customers. With regard to storage infrastructure capabilities, cloud service providers have developed the skills to implement storage management tools and are using open source tools for storage delivery, reducing dependency on proprietary storage arrays. Usage and billing has developed into sophisticated dashboards that allow hourly consumption monitoring, with immediate billing based on usage per hour. At this stage of maturity, there is an emphasis on building joint solutions, as well as building and commercializing your own IP. Solutions can be horizontal (business process or technology) or vertical focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> With orchestration as the base, the next development should be automation. This will enable you to run a highly profitable cloud business, but requires investment in tools and training at all levels. This includes creating the ability to template and replicate infrastructure deployment steps by simply running code (e.g., Red Hat Ansible). You should also develop the capability to manage complex PaaS and container environments, along with high-level tools and the backend strength to allow customers to set up automated load balancing and "bursting." 
            </p>
            <p>
                To achieve this, start the process of certifying joint vendor solutions (where possible) with a view to selling through alternative channels such as cloud marketplaces. Look to combine solutions with a view to building a digital transformation stack. This can be targeted at business functions (HR, accounting, finance, etc.) and at vertical sector levels (pharma, manufacturing, government, etc.).

            <p>
                Service providers in this stage have achieved a sophisticated, highly automated, and redundant cloud infrastructure. They have expertise in tools and management technology and typically offer customers a choice of delivery options (on-premise, off-premise, and through multiple CSPs). As such, they have developed sophisticated hybrid cloud capabilities, allowing planned and unplanned bursting. This connects to both customer premise and third-party service providers, as well as load balancing and auto-scale capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                OpenStack offerings are polished and enhanced by automation tools, enabling service providers to deliver the latest PaaS capabilities. They are also likely to be running multiple datacenter infrastructure (owned or in co-location) with private network connectivity options. Billing is delivered on an hourly basis, across all third-party cloud services and supported via a client dashboard. Solutions form part of a broader digital transformation agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> At this stage of maturity, scale becomes a key KPI. It is advisable to continuously certify solutions with strategic vendor partners and consider certifying IP-based solutions and tools to be sold through cloud marketplaces. You should invest in continuously building services and tools to support digital transformation, including process reengineering and rapid systems integration capabilities.

            <p>
                3rd Platform digital technologies (including mobile, cloud, Big Data analytics, and social) and associated services should also be investigated and wrapped into your offerings. This includes incorporating Innovation Accelerators such as artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, and robotics. Further actions include developing your current routes to market and scaling your existing business models. Also consider licensing solutions to other partners and expanding alternative channels.

                Cloud service providers at this stage in their sale and marketing maturity have a limited number of sales professionals focused on cloud services, with the majority still selling on-premise solutions. Sales teams primarily sell to an IT audience and as such marketing activity is focused on these personas (or individual role-based targets). Sales teams do not have cloud-specific targets and are all incentivized through upfront commission structures. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Service providers at this stage tend to use traditional approaches, relying on outbound communications to drive leads, in participation events. They have little means of tracking success or refining their approach. Marketing success comes from a mixture of the marketing efforts of vendor partners, as well as some localized efforts, with little control on where and how this is used. Organizations at this stage rarely measure customer satisfaction, relying on sales and renewal of existing contracts to measure success. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> As your organization begins to shift toward cloud, you will need to migrate sales away from on-premise solutions and toward recurring-revenue business models. Critically, incentives and commission structures will need to change to accommodate this, gearing the sales team around renewals and longer-term relationships. Upfront compensation (a percentage of first year revenue) is the most common model of remuneration, but it is also critical to encourage a long-term focus on renewals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Marketing needs to evolve beyond traditional outbound and events-driven activities. Digital marketing efforts will be central to this, but a task team (consisting of senior leadership, product, marketing, and sales professionals) must agree on your marketing transformation. You also need to actively segment and target your existing customer base, focusing on areas that deliver marketing success, as well as on approaches which have historically delivered the best returns in terms of sales.

                Service providers at this stage in their cloud sales and marketing maturity are beginning to build a team of specialists with the capabilities needed to close cloud business. Despite this, commission structures may still be based on first year subscriptions or license fees rather than on recurring revenues and renewals. Sales teams are beginning to sell into LOBs, but marketing efforts and sales capability is primarily focused on an IT audience. Sales people are beginning to use the sales enablement resources available to them (typically via vendor partner portals), including cloud readiness tools, sales playbooks, FAQs, and documents designed to help overcome sales objections. Sales people are also going through sales certification training with key vendor partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marketing communicates to specific target segments, often where there has been historic success. Many organizations are starting to explore digital marketing channels, but this lacks the sophistication of tracking or understanding detailed customer requirements. Many rely on vendor contributions, or general awareness messaging to drive sales, rather than specific and measurable campaigns. Customer satisfaction tends to be measured on an informal basis and often only annually.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Cloud service providers at this stage should look to evolve commission structures to incentivize teams over the lifetime of the customer. This will drive both customer satisfaction and renewals. As your cloud business starts to gather momentum, it is critical to make it easier for your sales people to upsell related services and solutions. Consider associating standard service offerings such as training and support to your cloud services, and package and bill these on a subscription basis.

                Build your digital marketing capabilities across the organization as part of a broader marketing transformation journey. As part of this process, it is advisable to create alignment between your marketing and the cloud buyers\' journey so you are able to define your value proposition and generate marketing activities at each stage. Equally, work closely with your vendor partner to define roadmaps for cloud and joint thought leadership in this area. Show customers that there is a defined process for adoption and utilization of cloud services.

                Organizations at this stage typically have a good understanding of customer requirements. They tend to communicate through appropriate channels using messages that resonate and guide cloud buyers through the sales cycle. Metrics are also utilized, tracking campaigns against predetermined objectives, and customer satisfaction is measured, but mainly through independent surveys, for example. Many companies have started to customize syndicated content from key vendor partners to tailor it to their audiences.

                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Cloud service providers at this stage in their maturity should look to evolve commission structures. These should include specific KPIs, such as customer satisfaction scores, additional incentives for new customer acquisition, and renewal rates. It is advisable at this point to create a more formalized proof-of-concept strategy. Investing in your own demo and trial facilities will help new customers visualize their own solutions. This is a powerful sales tool, particularly if you can incorporate customer data and bolster presales capabilities to support the sales process.

                It becomes imperative at this point to increase your online presence and start to build a digital marketing plan. Your vendor partner can help guide you in this process. Reassignment of marketing budgets, recruitment (or partnering) for digital resources, and a series of digital activities will all help awareness building, social selling (lead generation), and establishing thought leadership objectives. It is also recommended that you start building clear metrics and KPIs for all marketing activities (both traditional and digital). Awareness building and thought leadership are difficult to measure, but critical for long-term success.

                Cloud service providers at this stage have integrated cloud into all of their sales team portfolios. They are utilizing sophisticated presales support activities and delivering well qualified and progressed sales leads. Cloud architecture best practice is being sold to customers across multiple delivery options, with a mixture of upfront and ongoing commission structures. Sales teams are far more likely to sell based on business outcomes than on solution features, and typically demo and proof-of-concept facilities are actively used as part of the presales process. Sales tools and collateral are constantly updated and sales staff attend regular training.

                Organizations have developed sophisticated segmentation of their target base, enabling them to fully utilize automation software and deliver appropriate content to specific individuals.

Service providers at this stage are also active participants in thought leadership content and campaigns and providing material which educates the target market on cloud. Customer satisfaction is actively measured through customer support and delivery scores.
            </p>

                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> As you continue to mature, sales incentives need to be consistent and increasingly geared toward delivering customer value. This is regardless of the cloud delivery model. As your structure evolves, you should explore hiring ex-industry and business process focused sales and marketing professionals, enabling you to build even closer relationships with key clients and drive specialisms in key markets. Sales teams and presales must be able to work with vendors to co-innovate solutions, as well as incentivize teams, based on specific KPIs such as customer satisfaction, growth, and renewal rates.

                By actively measuring all aspects of your marketing, you will be in a far superior position to know what works well and what does not. More to the point, you will understand what can be improved and what needs to evolve as the business changes. It is critical here to drive the business toward a lower cost per close target, utilizing deep analysis of campaign results to drive greater levels of efficiency. Work with your vendor to understand best practice and learn from wider activities in the market. Identify potential thought leaders and trusted advisors from within different business units. Again, thought leaders from your vendor partners can also be layered into this approach.

                <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Enablement activities should focus on digital transformation across marketing and sales functions. Further recruitment of vertical and business function sales staff will also help cement your position in certain markets, enabling you to retain key customers and grow the business further. You should look to hire non-traditional skills for digital capabilities, data science, and deep analytics.

                The processes of targeting, tracking, and metrics require constant evolution, with new tools coming to market. It is therefore advisable to continuously leverage these to remain ahead of the curve. You should look to evolve thought leadership and strategic advisory through evangelism. Start to recruit, identify, and nurture evangelists internally (within your own organization) and externally within the media, analyst community, partner base, and ideally within your customer base. Look to drive thought leadership through activities such as speaking at events, blogs, videos, and social content. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You must also continue to drive alignment between sales and marketing capability. Marketing should function as an extended sales arm, and should have the same access to training. This will ensure messaging is consistent. Equally, the sales maturity of your organization needs to leverage a combination of digital, social, and content-driven approaches. This includes customer analytics and the targeting of individuals with specific messaging. Tight alignment between marketing and sales is critical in the digital age and will be a key differentiator in a competitive marketplace.
