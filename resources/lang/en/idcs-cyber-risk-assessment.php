            We\'re now going to look at how you performed in three key areas of Cyber Risk Readiness. In each case, we\'ll look at how you compared to others in the same readiness ranking of <strong>:rating</strong> as yourself. To do this, we look at whether you are behind, in-line or ahead of your peers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are in-line, you are broadly comparable to most companies at your level of readiness. If you are ahead, you are doing well in this area and should be looking at other areas to improve to get a balanced approach. If you are behind, you need to focus attention and investment in this area to bring your Cyber Risk Readiness in to line.
        </p>

If you achieve a rating of in-line or ahead in all sections, you are ready to be moving up a readiness level in short order."
