                Focusing on cost savings as the key driver for cloud migration and application modernization efforts might initially seem like the most sensible approach, but is it? Early stage cloud adoption was often driven by the expectation to save costs when moving from a capex model on premises to an opex model in the cloud. However, the business case in the cloud does not stack up if you are not also changing your processes so that you scale your application usage up and down according to demand. In addition, <span class="font-bold">cloud as an operating model provides so many other benefits like access to innovative services and support of an agile working culture, which provide more significant advantages than "only" cost savings. To get to the next level, you should think more broadly about the benefits that a cloud and application modernization strategy can provide for your organization.  </span>

                Cloud is a great way to drive operational efficiency at the infrastructure layer, as the cloud provider manages the infrastructure for you so you can free up IT infrastructure operations staff and focus them on other tasks. However, the move to the cloud requires new skills as well, so you need to retrain your staff with cloud management capabilities or look to external resources to fill the gaps. In addition, please consider that <span class="font-bold">cloud offers much more than operational efficiency and is the foundation for digital transformation. To move to the next level of cloud maturity, you might want to investigate how you can use the cloud for business model innovation and transformation, for example by opening up your data and driving new revenue streams from your data in a compliant way</span>.
