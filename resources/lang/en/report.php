    'digital-readinesssummary'=>"According to your responses in this section, your organization's status in terms of digital readiness is",
    'digital-readiness1'=>"Ready for digital means ready for change. IDC defines digital transformation as the process by which companies drive disruptive changes in their markets by leveraging digital competencies, resulting in better products and customer experiences. Having rich, meaningful data about the customer and the business, being effective in communicating with prospects, and enabling high employee productivity are all signs of digital readiness. In this research, digital readiness was the weakest area across the businesses that IDC polled, with around 40% in \"reactive\" mode. As a startup and midsize business, you have the \"nimbleness advantage\" against larger competitors when it comes to steering change. We recommend that you make sure you have the motivation for it too.",
    'digital-readiness2'=>"Create a base by measuring business results more regularly. Only 40% of midsize and small businesses gather business information every month or more often. Just as many don't measure their results regularly at all. Every digital strategy has to start with consistent, predictable measurements of investments and initiatives.",
    'digital-readiness3'=>"Start testing Big Data analytics solutions. To acquire and retain customers, it is crucial to connect the dots between traditional datasets in structured SQL format (used by most organizations) and new, Internet-originated data sources. In order to do this, new technologies might be needed. First, brainstorm with your marketing and business analysts about which data sources they deem important. Second, ask your system integrator or supplier to educate you about their offerings in the Hadoop, in-memory, or NoSQL space.",
    'digital-readiness4'=>"Increase workspace productivity by enabling BYOD. Organizations can only be successful in digital transformation if their employees are culturally in tune with mobile technologies and apps. IDC found a strong correlation between competitive push and well-planned support for bring your own device (BYOD) scenarios. Currently, less than 25% of companies give full access to core, yet secured, applications in BYOD mode.",
    'infrastructure-foundationsummary'=>"According to your responses in this section, your organization's status in terms of infrastructure foundation is",
    'infrastructure-foundation1'=>"Strong infrastructure foundations are a combination of high-control mission-critical environments and flexible cloud spaces. IDC believes standardized IT components, solid data and application management, and strong outward connectivity are paramount to enable hybrid cloud scenarios. Only around 20% of the companies IDC surveyed were deemed to be \"agile\" in the space, with the largest cluster (more than 50%) performing averagely. Start by mapping data and applications in a sensitivity versus scalability matrix, and then create a continuous roadmap on how to leverage different delivery mechanisms for each of those (traditional infrastructure for stable workloads, private cloud on premises, private cloud off premises, etc.). Costs and staff productivity are the all-important rewards.",
    'infrastructure-foundation2'=>"Go beyond server virtualization. IDC estimates that more than 70% of all new servers sold in Europe in 2015 for suitable environments were virtualized. While server virtualization is seen as a good first step in transforming from physical to abstract resources, IDC studies have shown that on its own it is not enough to reduce operating expenses. To improve efficiency, look into prepackaged converged and hyperconverged systems, and more importantly plan to standardize and exploit your management tools.",
    'infrastructure-foundation3'=>"Build modular infrastructures. 50% of your peers feel their infrastructure wouldn't be able to scale if demand were to grow. This is worrying: next-generation applications such as rich ecommerce or data analytics are by nature less predictable. Look into ways to make your infrastructure easy to expand. Start by bringing the storage and server back-end closer together with management tools and standardize on fewer storage platforms. If you are willing to go one step ahead, virtualize your storage and network pools, and then look for ways to execute planned capacity \"bursting\" into cloud resources with orchestration tools such as OpenStack.",
    'infrastructure-foundation4'=>"Bring innovation into storage. Not every company needs to build large storage area networks (SANs). Now, however, is as good a time as any to explore storage options. Look to refresh your midrange to high-end blocks with all-flash arrays (AFAs) for the most demanding applications. Also, benchmark applications that have directly correlated compute and storage demands (e.g., VDI) on software-defined storage environments running on standard x86 servers.",
    'it-business-synergysummary'=>"According to your responses in this section, your organization's status in terms of IT-business synergy is",
    'it-business-synergy1'=>"Only companies with functional processes can remain agile long term. While technology pillars need to be solid and attitudes open to change, progress will be short lived without a healthy relationship between the two. With virtually all business operations relying on IT, the most advanced and most agile organizations will be those that have embraced this synergy. Indicators of a symbiotic relationship include clear visibility for IT on cloud initiatives and spending, high awareness of the business impact of IT downtime, and knowledge in the business units of the crucial role data protection mechanisms play in ensuring compliance. One of three organizations surveyed by IDC was well behind in these parameters.",
    'it-business-synergy2'=>"Measure the business impact of downtime. Around 80% of the organizations interviewed felt they could not remain functional for more than eight hours with IT systems down. The negative business impact resulting from the failure to provide sufficient availability levels can run into hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue per hour even for midsize companies. Establishing a clear risk metric in case of unplanned downtime of both mission-critical and productivity-critical applications should be a priority.",
    'it-business-synergy3'=>"Integrated archive in your overall data protection workflow. In a number of industries, including healthcare, long-term archiving is mandatory. With file sizes exploding (particularly for video), storage assets often need rethinking. While technology offers abound (purpose-built backup appliances, cold storage, object storage), it is mandatory for IT and business units to conduct reviews of the data types and related business process first.",
    'it-business-synergy4'=>"Think flexibility together with (and not after) savings. IT budgets rarely grow, but planning IT strategies exclusively on cost reduction will put your overall organization at risk. Start measuring new key performance indicators like time-to-deploy new applications and end-user satisfaction. ",
    'conclusion'=>"At a time when disruptors are shaking up the established markets, relying on cloud services to reach into new segments, mobile apps to interact with customers, and Big Data analytics to target these customers, it is crucial for small and midsize businesses in Europe to step up their IT game and become truly agile. IDC research shows that SMBs that were able to open up the infrastructure foundations to a hybrid, interconnected world, increase employee productivity by reducing time-to-application, and expand skills and toolsets to protect and extract value from the internal and external data sources achieved significantly higher revenue growth over the past 12 months and have a greater chance to succeed in their digital transformation journey over the next 12 months. IDC recommends that you use this time to reassess your IT strategy and the relationship between developer, business units, and IT operations. The future of your company — not only of your IT department — depends on it.",
