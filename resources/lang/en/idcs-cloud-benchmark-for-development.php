                Organizations at this stage in their cloud maturity process tend to be providing cloud at the request of their customers, or as a vendor reseller. As a result, fees are derived from referrals or from resale, and organizations are generally focused on project revenues, rather than longer-term recurring revenue streams. Organizations at this stage in their cloud strategy are yet to embrace a cloud future and as a result may struggle to generate profits in this area. There is no defined vision for cloud, but there is time to make this transition if key decision makers act now.

            <p>
                Organizations at this stage in their cloud maturity are beginning to develop and deliver cloud-specific business models. Typically, this is not granular enough to account for different product lines or individual P&L, and is often unmanaged and untargeted. With measurement limited, there is little in the way of automation, whether it is process, methodology, or sale and delivery. While businesses at this stage of maturity are beginning to build cloud sales functions and cloud-based marketing, revenue still comes from resale of on-premise solutions. Despite this, recurring revenue growth is outpacing traditional business.

                Organizations at this stage in their cloud maturity have a solid cloud business plan in place and are developing product-specific strategies, including professional services. Investments in cloud have been made and, more critically, investments are planned for the next two to three years. Organizations are beginning to monitor and target cloud-based revenues separately from license and other revenues. Many are also creating reusable processes and beginning to automate key functions. Marketing efforts are showing signs of sophistication, yet many organizations still need to migrate away from traditional marketing approaches. Organizations at this stage are likely to have established a well-structured technology roadmap and have started investing in cloud infrastructure, tools, and management technology.

                Organizations at this stage in their cloud maturity have developed in-depth planning across different cloud products, solutions, and architectures. This includes go-to-market strategies and sophisticated sales enablement. Many have established a portfolio of cloud offerings and related services, mainly through dedicated cloud sales, implementation, and support functions. Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity can execute across multiple cloud architectures and have identified areas of specialism. This also enables them to measure and assess recurring revenues, and most have established tools and methodologies to drive efficiencies in implementation. This ensures renewals and the optimization of solutions.

They are also fully committed to a recurring revenue business model. All aspects of the business are focused on a broad set of KPIs, from customer adoption and growth targets, to satisfaction levels and renewal rates. All systems and processes are designed to optimize cloud profitability and many have fully automated cloud processes to deliver economies of scale. Critically, there is an emphasis on selling solutions, as well as developing and maximizing internal IP.

            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 1 in terms of your cloud strategy and vision. 14% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 2. Typically, organizations at this stage of their strategy maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Planning:</h3>
        <p>
            There is no defined vision for a future cloud business or any kind of overarching strategy. Your approach to cloud is rather ad hoc and reactive. Organizations at this stage in their cloud strategy are yet to fully embrace a cloud future and as a result may struggle to generate profits in this area.
        </p>
        <h3>Execution:</h3>
        <p>
            Most organizations in this stage of maturity are not geared to function as a cloud business and either refer cloud requests to their vendor partners or resell public cloud services to a limited base of existing customers. More critically, without specific revenue targets for cloud, many have no way of measuring cloud success and lack any direction in developing this part of their business further.

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Executive sponsorship:</h5>
        <p>
            This is crucial if the cloud business is going to mature. Your senior leadership need to start the process of defining a vision and building a task team to create and implement a cloud business model AND investment plan.
        </p>
        <h5>Opportunity assessment:</h5>
        <p>
            In order to get sufficient executive sponsorship across multiple lines of business it is advisable to start from an opportunity assessment. Start by analyzing the appetite for cloud across the key sectors you work with.
        </p>
        <h5>Address concerns:</h5>
        <p>
            You may well encounter a degree of FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) as you socialize your preliminary planning. It is recommended to start by addressing these concerns head on, before developing the vision and business plan.
        </p>
        ',
        'stage2'=>'
        <p>
            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 2 in terms of your cloud strategy and vision. 39% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations also positioned in Stage 2. Typically, organizations at this stage of their strategy and vision maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Planning:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage in their cloud strategy and vision are beginning to develop cloud business models and programs. Typically, however, this is not granular enough to account for different product lines (e.g., volume versus value SaaS). While the cloud sales and client engagement strategy is fairly well defined, it tends to be focused on existing markets only. You may have a good grasp of the sectors and markets you want to prioritize, but there is unlikely to be a formal go-to-market strategy.
        </p>
        <h3>Execution:</h3>
        <p>
            While some cloud initiatives are taking place, investments in this area may be limited. These tend to be small pockets of strategic activity rather than elements of a more cohesive execution strategy. Sales are starting to execute on a cloud sales strategy, supported by revenue targets and the beginnings of a business plan.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/cloud-vision-and-strategy.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Defined product strategies:</h5>
        <p>
            As your cloud business gathers momentum it is recommended that you layer your planning strategy across different product lines. This is critical for volume and value SaaS businesses, where capabilities and go-to-market requirements vary greatly.
        </p>
        <h5>Executive buy-in:</h5>
        <p>
            Focus on securing executive endorsement and buy-in to your cloud strategy. This needs to exist across all key business functions: senior leadership, marketing, sales, operations, and finance in order to scale and invest appropriately as your cloud business starts to mature.
        </p>
        <h5>Create financial models:</h5>
        <p>
            Your cloud planning needs to factor in growth, revenue, and, critically, profitability. Seek guidance and create financial models exploring the potential impact of recurring revenue on your topline revenue and profitability. 
        </p>
        ',
        'stage3'=>'
        <p>
            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 3 in terms of your cloud strategy and vision. 28% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 3. Typically, organizations at this stage of their strategy and vision maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Planning:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage, there is a cloud business plan in place. Product-specific strategies (e.g., volume versus value SaaS) are being developed, as well as plans around incorporating wider professional services propositions, such as business consulting, systems integration, migration, and managed services.
        </p>
        <h3>Execution:</h3>
        <p>
            Executive endorsement and buy-in of cloud now exists across core lines of business. As a result, you are proactively converting opportunities for cloud and have invested as part of a longer-term business strategy for the next two to three years. You are also looking for potential targets outside of their existing client base (new markets, new segments, new territories) to grow the business.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/cloud-vision-and-strategy.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Create advocacy:</h5>
        <p>
            Successful companies often use cloud internally as part of their own operations, and leverage these experiences to not only familiarize the entire organization with cloud, but also to potentially develop best practices.
        </p>
        <h5>Defined profitability plan:</h5>
        <p>
            Your financial planning needs to include a well-defined three-year profitability plan that factors in multiple scenarios regarding the impact of recurring revenue on your topline revenue and profitability.
        </p>
        <h5>Work closely with vendors:</h5>
        <p>
            Provide some visibility of your cloud strategy and vision with key strategic vendors and start building in processes to conduct joint planning, as well as regular performance reviews. Their buy-in at this stage of maturity and support for your strategy could significantly help you along the cloud journey.

            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 4 in terms of your cloud strategy and vision. 13% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 2. Typically, organizations at this stage of their strategy and vision maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Planning:</h3>
        <p>
            In-depth planning across different cloud products, solutions, and architecture is in place, including go-to-market strategies. Planning is also focused on deeper specialization, differentiation, and potential solution areas. The associated investment and go-to-market plans on building and selling these capabilities are also defined.
        </p>
        <h3>Execution:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage are executing on their cloud strategy and vision and have established a portfolio of cloud offerings and related services through dedicated sales, implementation, and support functions. You are also able to execute across multiple cloud architectures and have sufficient investment to execute on this strategy. Companies at this stage are actively delivering on growth strategies and go-to-market plans in order to target new clients and geographies.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/cloud-vision-and-strategy.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Verticalize your approach:</h5>
        <p>
            It would be advantageous to start verticalizing your execution strategies. In other words, building execution go-to-market strategies that target specific industries. This includes associating the solutions, sales resources, and marketing collateral to support this.
        </p>
        <h5>Begin developing IP:</h5>
        <p>
            As part of your strategic planning process, it is recommended that you build a technical strategy that focuses on developing solutions and reference architectures with the potential to be reused and even commercialized as standalone products.
        </p>
        <h5>Digital transformation strategy:</h5>
        <p>
            Your vision and strategy must also extend into building a broader digital transformation strategy. You must also look to incorporate your existing cloud strategies into this.

        'stage5'=>'
        <p>
            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 5 in its cloud strategy and vision maturity. Just 4% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 2. As a result, you\'re some way ahead of your peers, and your organization is characterized as a cloud business, rather than cloud being part of your offering. Typically, organizations at this stage of their strategy and vision maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Planning:</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud underpins significant investments and decisions surrounding the future of your business and the organization is committed to a recurring revenue business model, fueling growth and further specialization of capabilities. Your organization has built specific plans for targeting new markets and industries and works closely with its principal vendors to deliver joint account and marketing planning.
        </p>
        <h3>Execution:</h3>
        <p>
            All aspects of the business are focused on a broad set of KPIs, from customer adoption and growth targets, to satisfaction levels. In addition, professional services play a key role in both business targets and the delivery of cloud solutions. You are also in a position to offer any form of cloud architecture to your customers. Scale is a key motivator here and companies at this stage are executing on growth and scale strategies, typically targeting new clients and markets.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/cloud-vision-and-strategy.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Look to the future:</h5>
        <p>
            Continuously look to the future, developing your understanding of how cloud solutions will evolve and the wider integration of digital transformation processes and technologies. You should also be looking to geographic and sector expansion of your business and propositions.
        </p>
        <h5>Focus on developing IP:</h5>
        <p>
            Critically, set a strategic vision to become an organization focused on developing, refining, and selling IP to your existing and potential customer base. This approach will help define your future execution and planning strategies.
        </p>
        <h5>Differentiate through solutions:</h5>
        <p>
            Provide business value to clients by offering solutions to business issues. All of your strategic planning activities should focus on what business issues you are looking to solve for your customers.

Typically, organizations in this stage of maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Measurement:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage in their cloud maturity tend to be reactive, with limited measurements in place. As a result, their cloud offerings are unmanaged and untargeted.
        </p>
        <h3>Automation:</h3>
        <p>
            Many cloud projects are delivered on an ad hoc basis, with very few processes or methodologies either formalized or reused. Limited automation in sales and delivery processes places even greater pressure on margins.
        </p>
        <h3>Capability gap assessment:</h3>
        <p>
            With a view to your short-term, mid-term, and long-term skills requirements, you should look to understand where you are falling behind and where investments need to be made. Start the process of building a training plan by individual department: technical, marketing, and sales, for example.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Measurement is fundamental:</h5>
        <p>
            You need to start tracking recurring revenue growth by separating out cloud business revenues from existing license-based incomes. In addition, the delivery of cloud, and the impact of recurring revenue on your top and bottom line, needs to be understood longer term.
        </p>
        <h5>Automation:</h5>
        <p>
            While your cloud business is still small, the impact of limited automation is not felt. As it starts to scale, however, your organization will need reusable cloud methodologies and delivery mechanisms to ensure profitable delivery. Start by testing and trialing automation tools while the business is still small enough to manage without it. This way, you can plan for the future.

As a result, the maturity of your processes may need some refinement and there is some work to do on your cloud development and delivery. Typically, organizations in this stage of maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Measurement:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage are yet to separate out cloud in their financials. As a result, there is limited measurement of cloud success. Despite this, growth objectives are defined and targets are being implemented.
        </p>
        <h3>Automation:</h3>
        <p>
            There is typically a desire to build repeatable processes and methodologies to implement cloud projects. This includes recognition that automation is essential to running a profitable cloud business. Often, however, these capabilities are still in the early stages of development.
        </p>
        <h3>Capabilities:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage, staff are starting to be encouraged to attend vendor-specific training, but this is still fairly ad hoc, often self-driven and not built into a formal training plan.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Build KPIs:</h5>
        <p>
            Start to implement cloud-specific KPIs and metrics for both sales and operations, including growth targets for cloud. This will enable you to monitor and work toward defined objectives in terms of the recurring revenue contribution as a percentage of total revenue.
        </p>
        <h5>Creation of reusable processes:</h5>
        <p>
            This must become a longer-term goal, with systems, methodologies, and KPIs designed to optimize cloud profitability through high-margin recurring revenues. 
        </p>
        <h5>Certification and training:</h5>
        <p>
            As you evolve to the next stage of maturity, it will become necessary to organize a structured vendor certification plan with training targets. This will help build the capabilities needed to advance your cloud business and progress through the tiers with your cloud vendor partners.

Typically, organizations in this stage of maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Measurement:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage of cloud process maturity have built specific targets and measures for cloud services. Many have begun to monitor and target cloud-based revenues separately from license and other revenues.
        </p>
        <h3>Automation:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage, most are creating reusable processes for cloud implementations and are automating many of their key functions. Typically, they do not yet have sophisticated monitoring usage and optimization.
        </p>
        <h3>Capabilities:</h3>
        <p>
            At this point, companies are more organized around building cloud capability. They have started to create structured vendor certification plans with training targets. They have created KPIs across core business functions (technical, sales, and marketing) and are actively measuring these.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Automation and measurement:</h5>
        <p>
            Metrics should be introduced across the organization and externally to the customer site. This includes understanding how customers utilize, optimize, and assess cloud solutions. These trends and patterns can then be replicated to other customers.
        </p>
        <h5>Reusable processes and tools:</h5>
        <p>
            As you advance, processes and reusable tools should be continuously created, tested, deployed, and enhanced. This includes architectures and code that will result in reduced implementation efforts. Eventually this will lead to sustainable growth, economies of scale, and a more profitable and efficient cloud business.

            At this stage it is also advisable to start trialing and testing analytics tools across core business functions (sales, delivery operations, and marketing). These will become a key differentiator as the cloud business matures.

            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 4 and ahead of the general classification in terms of your cloud processes and skill-set maturity. 17% of organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority positioned in Stage 2. Typically, organizations in this stage of maturity share some of the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Measurement:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage in their cloud process maturity have developed and refined recurring revenue business models and metrics for measuring cloud business success. Some are starting to measure the lifetime value of customers, including the KPIs around customer retention, win-loss, and in some cases customer satisfaction.
        </p>
        <h3>Automation:</h3>
        <p>
            Most have established tools and methodologies to drive efficiency in implementation and ensure customers renew and optimize solutions. Ongoing developments in automation capabilities also allow the business to scale.
        </p>
        <h3>Capabilities:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, companies have a good grasp on their existing capabilities and skills gaps. Typically, capability building is aligned to an organized and structured vendor certification plan with training targets across different business units.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Measurement:</h5>
        <p>
            You should look for constant evolution in your measurement and it is recommended that you build advanced metrics to measure hybrid cloud, regular customer satisfaction, and efficiencies of service delivery. This includes implementation and support.
        </p>
        <h5>Optimization:</h5>
        <p>
            It is important to introduce measurement and metrics in order to optimize efficient service delivery. This creates the ability to incentivize service delivery teams on efficiency and customer satisfaction improvements. As your cloud business starts to scale, efficiency will really make a difference to your bottom line.
        </p>
        <h5>Analytics:</h5>
        <p>
            Capabilities in analytics should continuously evolve across relevant business functions: finance, sales, service delivery, marketing, and CRM. As you progress to the next stage of maturity this will be a key differentiator.

        <h3>Measurement:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage of their maturity have well-defined metrics and KPIs across all relevant business functions. Systems and processes are designed to optimize cloud profitability.
        </p>
        <h3>Internal IP:</h3>
        <p>
            In many cases, organizations at this stage are selling and delivering their own cloud and SaaS services, achieving high margins and ensuring their repeat revenue goals are met and measured.
        </p>
        <h3>Automation:</h3>
        <p>
            You have fully automated many of your cloud processes, optimizing cloud solutions and delivering economies of scale into all aspects of the business. At this stage, automation is closely tied to strong analytic capabilities, including customer usage and performance of applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Capabilities:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, you have achieved certifications to the highest tiers of vendor programs. Typically, these organizations have best-in-class service delivery frameworks and tools.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Scale and reach:</h5>
        <p>
            Even at this high level of process maturity, you need to continue to enhance systems and services to work at scale, creating further specialization and higher levels of process automation. This reduces time to complete projects, generating greater profitability and growth. You should place even greater emphasis on scalability, ensuring that the business is able to fulfil opportunities and maximize its wider capabilities.
        </p>
        <h5>Automation:</h5>
        <p>
            Ensuring that automation is driven into all areas of the business will enable your organization to monitor usage, optimize customer utilization and cloud service delivery, and streamline and maximize sales processes and delivery.
        </p>
        <h5>Analytics:</h5>
        <p>
            You need to start leveraging some of the analytics capabilities to provide value to customers, such as providing predictive analytics on resource utilization.
        </p>
        <h5>Digital transformation:</h5>
        <p>
            At this stage, your priority and training plans should be focused on building capabilities to support broader digital transformation objectives. This includes areas such as digital, integration, and business processes.

            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 1 in terms of your cloud marketing maturity. 28% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 1. Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Marketing activities:</h3>
        <p>
            Predominantly you use traditional approaches (events, collateral, sponsorships). As a result, marketing success comes from a mixture of vendor activities and some localized efforts with little control on where and how this is used.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales alignment:</h3>
        <p>
            Typically, organizations at this stage rely on outbound communications to drive leads, with little means of tracking success or qualifying leads. There is also little measurement of refinement.
        </p>
        <h3>Thought leadership:</h3>
        <p>
            Companies at this stage typically focus on more traditional marketing and do not proactively build thought leadership content such as blogs, video tutorials, and white papers.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/marketing.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Marketing transformation:</h5>
        <p>
            To drive future successes in cloud, your organization needs to rethink its marketing approach and employ far more sophisticated methods. Digital marketing will be central to this, but this require a change in mindset for the whole organization. Build a task team consisting of senior leadership, product, marketing, and sales to guide and manage your marketing transformation.
        </p>
        <h5>Segment and measure:</h5>
        <p>
            You need to actively segment and target your existing customer base, focusing in on areas that deliver marketing success and on approaches that have historically delivered the best returns. Rather than a random approach to communications, repurposing content and evolving messages to specific audiences is a recommended approach. To achieve this, you need to start tracking marketing efforts, while working with vendors to better communicate cloud propositions.
        </p>
        <h5>Cloud journey-based content:</h5>
        <p>
            You should start building your own voice to customers, many of which will also be at the early stages of their cloud journey. This requires advice, educational content, and the clear communication of relative advantages and disadvantages of cloud versus on-premise. Start by leveraging some of the syndicated content available from your vendor partners, but look to lend your own voice and customize to your market and audience.
        </p>

        'stage2'=>'
        <p>
            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 2 in terms of your cloud marketing maturity. 26% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 1. Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Marketing activities:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage in their cloud marketing maturity are primarily focused on traditional approaches (events, collateral, sponsorships) but are starting to explore digital marketing channels.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales alignment:</h3>
        <p>
            You most likely do a combination of your own lead generation activities and joint activities with your vendors. This enables you to qualify leads and continuously measure and refine your approach.
        </p>
        <h3>Thought leadership:</h3>
        <p>
            Companies at this stage typically focus on more traditional marketing and do not proactively build thought leadership content such as blogs, video tutorials, and white papers.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/marketing.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Define a cloud journey:</h5>
        <p>
            Continue to build your digital marketing capabilities across the organization as part of a broader marketing transformation journey. As part of this process it is advisable to create alignment between your marketing and the cloud buyers\' journey. This ensures that you are able to define your value proposition and generate marketing activities at each stage of this process.
        </p>
        <h5>Marketing metrics:</h5>
        <p>
            These should be created around lead qualification and generation. They should be tailored to each marketing activity and channel, such as traditional events based marketing, outbound marketing, and digital marketing. Metrics should also be defined in terms of wider marketing objectives, such as awareness building, branding, and lead generation.
        </p>
        <h5>Thought leadership:</h5>
        <p>
            At this stage it makes sense to customize syndicated content, which is widely available from your vendor partners. You also need to start building a plan for your own thought leadership activities in which you engage directly with your market and audience. This includes blogs, forums, papers, and references.

Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Marketing activities:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage in their cloud marketing maturity have a good understanding of customer requirements and communicate through appropriate channels. Metrics are also utilized, tracking campaigns against predetermined objectives.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales alignment:</h3>
        <p>
            Companies at this stage have started to develop messages that resonate and guide cloud buyers through the sales cycle. This includes closer alignment with the sales department and many no longer have to rely on vendor campaigns to drive lead generation.
        </p>
        <h3>Thought leadership:</h3>
        <p>
            Although still limited, companies at this stage have started to customize syndicated content from key vendor partners, tailoring it to their audiences. Some have started to blog and use other social forums, but activities tend to be ad hoc and driven by individuals rather than the company.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/marketing.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Build digital marketing capability:</h5>
        <p>
            It becomes imperative at this point to increase your online presence. Start by building a digital marketing plan that factors in recruitment (or partnering) for digital resources and a series of digital activities. These spread across awareness building, social selling (lead generation), and establishing thought leadership objectives. Refreshing your website and looking at ways to drive customers to your site through relevant and insightful content and advice is also recommended.
        </p>
        <h5>Drive the sales cycle:</h5>
        <p>
            You need to look at marketing not as a way to generate warm leads, but as a way to deliver the sales teams with prospects that are halfway through the sales process. This means you need to be able to deliver the right information, education, and content to a range of potential cloud customers, through a set of sophisticated digital content tools. This also requires a department structured to create and maintain them.
        </p>
        <h5>Metrics and KPIs:</h5>
        <p>
            Segmentation will enable your organization to execute an efficient cost-per-close for your cloud business, eventually leveraging a combination of digital, social, and content-driven approaches. It is recommended to start building very clear metrics and KPIs for all marketing activities (both traditional and digital) but these cannot be limited to purely leads generated.

Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Marketing activities:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage have developed sophisticated segmentation of their target base, with some utilization of marketing automation software and tools. This is enabling the delivery of appropriate content to specific individuals.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales alignment:</h3>
        <p>
            Digital marketing is functioning as essentially an extension of the sales process. This is enabling marketing to deliver prospects that have been guided through a large part of the sales cycle, using digital content they have discovered themselves.
        </p>
        <h3>Thought leadership:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage are active participants in thought leadership content and campaigns, providing materials that educate the target market and deliver the business as a leader in this field.
        </p>
        <img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/marketing.jpg" class="right">
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Continue to develop measurement:</h5>
        <p>
            By actively measuring all aspects and elements of your marketing, you will be better able to know what works well and what does not. More to the point, what can be improved and what needs to evolve as the business changes. Measurement will also enable you to utilize deep analysis of campaign results to drive even greater levels of efficiency.
        </p>
        <h5>Align sales and marketing:</h5>
        <p>
            Marketing should function as an extended sales arm, with the same access to training and ensuring a tight alignment between the two. Sales maturity needs to leverage a combination of digital, social, and content-driven approaches. This includes customer analytics and the targeting of specific individuals within organizations.
        </p>
        <h5>Incentivize your own thought leaders:</h5>
        <p>
            You should look to identify potential thought leaders and trusted advisors from within different business units (sales, marketing, services, solutions, executive leadership) and incentivize them for participating in thought leadership activities. This includes speaking at events, writing blogs, creating videos, and driving social content, for example.

            Organizations at this stage in their cloud marketing maturity are able to leverage a combination of digital, social, and content-driven approaches. This includes customer analytics and persona targeting. Many organizations at this stage are able to drive a far lower cost-per-close target, utilizing deep analysis of campaign results to drive even greater levels of efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales alignment:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, there is very tight alignment between sales and marketing functions, and marketing is recognized as an extended sales force and treated (and incentivized) accordingly.
        </p>
        <h3>Thought leadership:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity the organization is recognized as a credible thought leader and strategic advisor. Thought leadership is ongoing and educational content is provided frequently and across multiple channels.

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Continuous evolution and development:</h5>
        <p>
            Processes for targeting, tracking, and sophisticated metrics require constant evolution. With new tools coming to market, it is advisable to continuously leverage these to remain ahead of the curve.
        </p>
        <h5>Marketing efficiencies:</h5>

        </p>
        <h3>People:</h3>
        <p>
            You likely have a limited number of sales professionals certified and focused on selling SaaS services, with the majority of sales activity focused on selling on-premise solutions. Sales teams do not have cloud-specific targets and often incentive structures for SaaS subscriptions are ill-defined.
        </p>
        <h3>Enablement</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, it is likely that sales enablement for selling SaaS is ad hoc and focused around specific opportunities. It is unlikely that sales people in this stage of maturity are fully leveraging the tools, collateral, and other enablement activities provided by vendor partners.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Selling SaaS does not form a core part of sales strategy at this early stage, and is typically sold in a reactive basis in response to customer demand.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Sales specialists:</h5>
        <p>
            Begin developing a team of cloud presales specialists, with the capabilities needed to close cloud-specific business in conjunction with account managers.
        </p>
        <h5>Incentives and commission:</h5>
        <p>
            As your organization begins to shift toward cloud, you will need to migrate sales away from on-premise solutions toward recurring revenue-based business models. Incentives and commission structures will need to change to accommodate this. Fundamental to achieving this is gearing the sales team around renewals and building longer-term relationships. It is advisable to start implementing the changes to commission structures early, with upfront compensation (a percentage of first-year revenues) the most common model of remuneration.
        </p>
        <h5>Collateral and training:</h5>
        <p>
            In this early stage of maturity, training and enablement should focus on building the sales skills to sell SaaS effectively. Understanding the benefits to customers and arguments to help overcome objections is critical. Make it easier for sales people by identifying the training and enablement tools that are required at this early stage, and make training attendance a main KPI.

        </p>
        <h3>People:</h3>
        <p>
            You are beginning to build a team of cloud specialists with the capabilities needed to close cloud business. Commission structures have evolved to either a percentage of first-year revenues or a straight recurring revenue commission. Some are a combination of the two models. Very few organizations have put in place additional incentives for customer renewals and usage, but this should become a priority.
        </p>
        <h3>Enablement</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, sales people are starting to actively use the sales enablement resources available to them (typically via vendor partner portals). Sales people are also going through sales certification training with key vendor partners.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud is becoming core to sales strategy and is often a door opener for other sales opportunities (upsell). It is advisable at this stage of your cloud maturity to make it easier for sales people to upsell (products) and sell services attached to SaaS deals. You should look to incorporate "upsell" as a core component of sales strategy moving forward.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Commission:</h5>
        <p>
            Look to evolve commission structures to incentivize sales people over the lifetime of the customer, and drive a focus on customer satisfaction and renewals.
        </p>
        <h5>Focus sales on cloud:</h5>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, you need to integrate cloud offerings into your sales effort and competencies, making this the core focus of the business and central to sales-based conversations. Leverage vendor sales toolkits, create your own playbooks, and continuously train.
        </p>
        <h5>Upsell services and solutions:</h5>
        <p>
            As your cloud business starts to gather momentum, make it easier for sales people to upsell related services and solutions. Consider associating standard service offerings such as training and support to your SaaS business. Package and bill these on a subscription basis so these can be sold alongside the SaaS subscription.

Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>People:</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud sales are supported by a set of well-qualified presales leads and sales professionals able to offer an array of cloud solutions to fulfil a range of customer requirements. At this stage of maturity, incentive structures for cloud are well defined but do not extend to the lifetime of a customer.
        </p>
        <h3>Enablement</h3>
        <p>
            Sales teams are increasingly trained in cloud capabilities and certification. Enablement has extended from training to active participation in lead generation activities by both internal marketing departments and those initiatives by cloud vendor partners.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud has been integrated into all the sales team\'s portfolios. Most sales people are able to competently provide customers advice on cloud, and quote on a choice of on-premise and cloud options.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Sales sophistication:</h5>
        <p>
            Look to evolve commission structures to include specific KPIs, such as customer satisfaction scores and additional incentives for new customer acquisition and renewal rates. As your structure evolves, you will need to build line-of-business sales skills, enabling you to build even closer relationships with key clients, as well as drive specialisms in key markets.
        </p>
        <h5>Scale:</h5>
        <p>
            If you company is offering both volume and value SaaS, it is advisable to start differentiating your strategies for volume versus value SaaS. For volume SaaS, the ability to scale starts to become critical to growth. Your volume sales strategy should include an investment plan for sales automation, as well as investigating the potential of telesales capability. Consider investment in tools that create efficiencies in the sales process (sales automation tools). Your value sales strategy needs to encompass line-of-business selling and hiring, which includes hiring from industry, as well as building capabilities through training.
        </p>
        <h5>Develop proof of concept:</h5>
        <p>
            It is advisable at this point to create a more formalized proof-of-concept strategy, and potentially invest in your own demo and trial facilities. This will enable new customers to trial SaaS on a 30-day plan. This becomes a powerful sales tool, particularly if you can incorporate customer data and bolster presales capabilities to support the sales process.

            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 4 in terms of your cloud sales maturity. 16% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 2. Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>People:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage in their cloud sales maturity have integrated cloud into all of their sales team\'s portfolios, utilizing sophisticated presales support activities and pipeline and lead-management tools. Companies with a volume SaaS business are looking to reach scale via telesales and social selling, whereas those with a value SaaS strategy are actively focused on building line-of-business selling skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Incentives</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity, incentive structures for cloud are well defined and sales people are also more likely to be incentivized over the lifetime of the customer relationship. Commission structures are likely to continue to transform, becoming a mixture of upfront and ongoing incentives.
        </p>
        <h3>Enablement</h3>
        <p>
            Typically, demo and proof-of-concept facilities are available to customers and are actively used as part of the presales process. This could be the company\'s own investment, or leveraging its vendor\'s facilities, or a mix of both. Sales tools and collateral are constantly updated and refreshed.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            At this level of maturity, cloud architecture best practice is being sold to customers across multiple delivery options, with a mixture of upfront and ongoing commission structures. Sales teams are far more likely to sell based on business outcomes than on solution features and there is a growing specialism in the way sales teams are aligned with markets and business processes. Many companies are starting to create vertically structured solutions and sales departments.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Industry expertise:</h5>
        <p>
            As your structure evolves, look to explore hiring ex-industry and business-process focused sales professionals, enabling you to build even closer relationships with key clients, as well as drive specialisms in key markets
        </p>
        <h5>Evolve incentives:</h5>
        <p>
            As you continue to mature, sales incentives need to be consistent and increasingly geared toward delivering customer value, regardless of cloud delivery models.
        </p>
        <h5>Integration of sales and delivery:</h5>
        <p>
            Focus on closer and seamless integration between sales and delivery teams, ultimately driving growth, scalability, and profitability across all areas of the business. Automation and digitization of the sales process will be central to achieving this and sales incentives should consistently evolve toward delivering customer value, regardless of delivery models.
        </p>
        <h5>Co-innovation with vendors:</h5>
        <p>
            Sales teams and presales must be able to work with vendors to co-innovate solutions. Ultimately, you will be able to drive growth, scalability, and profitability into all areas of the business, and automation and digitization of the sales process will be central to achieving this.
        </p>
        <h5>Digital transformation:</h5>
        <p>
            Also critical at this stage is embedding your cloud capabilities into a broader digital transformation proposition. This incorporates a breadth of digital technologies, such as mobility, social, Big Data analytics, next-gen security, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

        </p>
        <h3>People:</h3>
        <p>
            Sales are able to sell solutions, services, and consulting based on business outcomes. They have typically recruited vertical and business function sales staff to cement their position in certain markets and enable them to retain key customers. At this stage of maturity, it is likely that your cloud business is evolving into one of the key pillars of broader digital transformation.
        </p>
        <h3>Incentives</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this advanced stage in their cloud sales maturity have sophisticated sales commission structures geared toward customer value, regardless of cloud delivery models. These include customer satisfaction, customer growth, and renewal rates. With so much achieved, it is critical for you to now maximize this position in the market.
        </p>
        <h3>Enablement</h3>
        <p>
            Enablement efforts are predominantly focused around digital transformation. This should encompass selling omni-channel solutions, building deeper understanding of business process, being able to communicate and sell business value, and selling to line-of-business customers.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            It is likely that you are already working with vendors to co-innovate solutions and you have developed sophisticated partnerships with vendors and customers. Ultimately, your sales function will begin to deliver the economies of scale you have sought, enabling you to drive profitability into all areas of the business and concentrate sales staff on new growth opportunities.
        </p>
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Digital transformation:</h5>
        <p>
            Customer engagement should focus on digital transformation enablement and sales skills. There should be a strong alignment between the marketing and sales departments, with marketing functioning as an extension of the sales force, particularly for new customer acquisition.
        </p>
        <!--h5>Hiring of wider skill-sets:</h5>
        <p>
            Further recruitment of vertical and business function sales staff will help cement your position in certain markets, enabling you to retain key customers over a number of years and grow the business further. Also consider hiring non-traditional skills for digital capabilities, data science, and deep analytics.
        </p-->
        <h5>Deeper partnerships:</h5>
        <p>
            Continuously invest in partnerships with strategic vendors, as well as with customers. This will help ensure continuous evolution of the sales process within the business.
        </p>
        <h5>Co-innovation with vendors:</h5>

        <p>
            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 1 in terms of the maturity of your cloud business mix. 4% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 3. Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Revenue contribution:</h3>
        <p>
            The majority of software revenue comes from the resell of on-premise licenses. Very few organizations in this stage of maturity have firm targets in place for growing any kind of recurring revenue contribution.
        </p>
        <h3>Partner programs</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations in this stage of maturity typically lie within the lowest tier in cloud-specific vendor programs (although they may be in higher tiers for on-premise products). Vendors such as Sage are currently increasing investments into channel lead generation, financial incentives, and enablement specifically for cloud and SaaS programs.
        </p>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
            Although organizations in this stage may offer software-related services such as consulting, customization, implementation, support, and training, they are rarely aligned or designed specifically to enhance their cloud software and SaaS businesses.
        </p>
        <h3>Cloud infrastructure:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage are yet to make significant investments in their own cloud infrastructure, tools, and management technology. As a result, they are unlikely to progress beyond basic resell and referral. This is mainly due to not having the capability to manage complex hybrid environments or additional value-adds such as unified billing, management, and security.
        </p>
        <h3>Solutions:</h3>
        <p>
            Very few organizations at this stage in their maturity have developed cloud-specific solutions (horizontal or vertical) in collaboration with vendor partners or have developed their own cloud IP.
        </p>
        <!--<img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/business-mix.jpg" class="right">-->
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Build a financial plan:</h5>
        <p>
            Incorporate recurring revenue into your business. If this is not done, you face a potential risk of a cash-flow "trough" as you shift from project-based to recurring revenue models. Build recurring revenue over time, creating stages within the plan and adjusting your product and services portfolio, as well as infrastructure investments, through each stage. Actively look to diversify revenue and reduce dependency on resell revenues. This will require careful assessment and planning across your services portfolio, cloud infrastructure, and solution offerings.
        </p>
        <h5>Vendor selection:</h5>
        <p>
            Look at your cloud vendor partners and prioritize those that are most strategic to your future business in terms of alignment with your target market and business mix. Work on a progression plan with these strategic vendors to progress to the next tier in their cloud partner programs.
        </p>
        <h5>Align service portfolio:</h5>
        <p>
            As you progress to the next stage of maturity it is recommended you look to align your services portfolio with your cloud and SaaS business and create those upsell opportunities. The margin in services is typically higher than resell and referral. Building a profitable services businesses attached to your cloud resell business will help bolster your bottom line. As you advance into the next stages, the more automated and repeatable these services are, the more profitable.
        </p>

        'stage2'=>'
        <p>
            Based on IDC\'s assessment, your organization is at Stage 2 in terms of the maturity of your cloud business mix. 16% of the organizations benchmarked in our research were at this stage, with the majority of organizations positioned in Stage 3. Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Revenue contribution:</h3>
        <p>
            While the majority of software revenue comes from the resell of on-premise licenses, recurring revenue growth is often outpacing that of traditional business. In this stage of maturity most organizations have just started assessing their recurring revenue contribution in relation to project-based business. Most are in the early stages of building a financial plan.
        </p>
        <h3>Partner programs</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage of maturity are prioritizing some vendor partners as strategic to their cloud business and are often progressing to a higher tier in cloud-specific vendor programs (although they may be in higher tiers for on-premise products).
        </p>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
            You are likely to be developing a services portfolio specifically designed for upsell from SaaS. This is typically focused on training, implementation, and support. As the cloud business gains momentum, so the company will start to build the experience and IP.
        </p>
        <h3>Cloud infrastructure:</h3>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity it is unlikely that your organization has made significant investments in your own cloud infrastructure and tools and management technology. Many are, however, starting to build a well-structured technology roadmap for both the technology and skills needed.
        </p>
        <!--<img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/business-mix.jpg" class="right">-->
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Financial plan:</h5>
        <p>
            At this stage of maturity it is advisable to build in a regular review process that monitors the contribution of recurring revenue, services revenue, and product resell revenue over time. Build an investment plan for scalable cloud infrastructure and tools to create value. This will also support efficient delivery of services, such as proactive managed services and hybrid management.
        </p>
        <h5>Develop IP:</h5>
        <p>
            Analyze past projects and identify technology solutions and services that have the potential to be productized as your own IP. Look to your existing account base to identify industries that present an opportunity for your company to develop specializations.
        </p>
        <h5>Vendor partnerships:</h5>
        <p>
            Explore with your vendor partners the potential opportunities for joint solution development (vertical or horizontal). You should also look to familiarize yourself with the requirements for advancement to a higher tier and continue to structure your own business planning to align with this. Requesting a joint business planning session with your cloud vendors will not only drive opportunities, but also signal your commitment.
        </p>
        <h5>Automation and upsell opportunities:</h5>
        <p>
            Successful cloud businesses use cloud as a door-opener for upselling services. The more automated and repeatable these services are, the more profitable they become. Even at this early stage of your cloud journey, it is recommended you design future services with automation in mind.

Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity share the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <h3>Revenue contribution:</h3>
        <p>
            The revenue generated solely from cloud is typically between 10% and 20% of total revenue. Recurring revenue is starting to gather momentum and its impact on cash flow is starting to be felt.
        </p>
        <h3>Partner programs</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage have typically identified which vendor partners are strategic to their cloud business and are in the process of progressing to a higher tier in vendor programs.
        </p>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
            SaaS has become embedded into a broader cloud portfolio and incorporates a range of SaaS-specific project-based services (training, consulting, implementation, and possibly integration). Many companies at this stage of maturity have also started to build a managed services portfolio attached to their cloud business.
        </p>
        <h3>Cloud infrastructure:</h3>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage are likely to have established a well-structured technology roadmap. They have started investing in cloud infrastructure, tools, and management technology to progress beyond basic resell and referral into a more profitable cloud business.
        </p>

        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Automation:</h5>
        <p>
            Organizations at this stage should emphasize building and extending automation capabilities for managed services associated with SaaS business. This is with a view to building proactive/preemptive services capabilities. As you advance into the next stages, the more automated and repeatable these managed services are, the more profitable your cloud business will be.
        </p>
        <h5>Expand vertical and horizontal solutions:</h5>
        <p>
            This will enable your business to achieve greater reach and scale, investing in deeper pockets of specialization.
        </p>
        <h5>Joint solutions with partners:</h5>
        <p>
            Regular business and account planning with strategic vendor partners will ensure close alignment and visibility. The roadmap should focus on building capability to fully support hybrid environments, also supporting more complex value-adds such as unified billing, network optimization, cloud management, and security. Future solutions should continue to be a key topic of discussion and should be incorporated into both joint business planning sessions and technical planning sessions.

        <h3>Revenue contribution:</h3>
        <p>
            Companies at this stage of maturity typically generate more revenue from delivering services than reselling product or licenses. Cloud tends to contribute to at least a third of total business and most organizations have fairly robust measuring and reporting on cloud. They also have a good understanding of the contribution recurring revenue has on total revenue.
        </p>
        <h3>Partner programs</h3>
        <p>
            Typically, organizations at this stage of maturity are able to support multiple environments and vendor products, but have established a strategic relationship with one or more cloud vendor. They are also progressing through the tiers, developing deeper expertise within these strategic vendor partners.
        </p>
        <h3>Services</h3>
        <p>
            Companies in this stage have a services portfolio for upsell from SaaS, including consulting, training, implementation, support, and managed services. As you advance into the next stages, the more automated and repeatable these services are, the more profitable.

        </p>
        <!--<img src="http://sage.idcready.net/images/tools/1/business-mix.jpg" class="right">-->
        <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
        <h5>Automation:</h5>
        <p>
            Look to extend automation capabilities for managed services associated with SaaS business. These services can be automated and therefore repeatable and are packaged and attached to SaaS portfolios for easier upsell. Typically, these managed services are able to support remote delivery.
        </p>
        <h5>Digital transformation:</h5>
        <p>
            You should look to combine solutions with a view to building a digital transformation stack at a business function and sector level. It is advisable at this stage of your journey to ensure that you have full visibility into customer usage of cloud, with preemptive renewals and actual usage data readily available. This will become increasingly important over time.
        </p>
        <h5>Joint vendor solutions:</h5>
        <p>
            Start the process of certifying joint vendor solutions (where possible) with a view to selling through alternative channels such as cloud marketplaces. In order to progress to the next stage of maturity, it is recommended to follow a portfolio approach in terms of capability development, with a view to becoming a certified solution provider with breadth in capability.
        </p>
        <h5>Solutions:</h5>
        <p>
            Solutions can be horizontal (technology) or vertical (industry focused) but they must also have a robust go-to-market and sales strategy associated with each one. As you advance into the next stage of maturity, you will need to sell at line-of-business level. This will be achieved by selling business transformation engagements and holistic technology solutions.
