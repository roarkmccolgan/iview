        <p class="mb-2">Thank you for completing the NTT Communications Next-Generation WAN Advisor, with research and analysis by IDC. As organizations implement digital transformation strategies they are faced with accelerating network requirements and the need for a network that supports the business outcomes they are aiming to achieve. Digital transformation should therefore go hand in hand with network evolution.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">IDC has developed the Next-Generation WAN Advisor to help organizations assess the state of their WAN, and benchmark this performance against their peers. This interactive self-assessment tool is backed up by independent end-user research and IDC\'s in-depth understanding of this market. The research draws upon input from 300 network experts and decision makers to understand how advanced different organizations are in terms of their WAN investment and approach.</p>

        <p class="mb-2">IDC has built a comparison framework in which individual responses from the survey are scored to group organizations into 3 levels of WAN maturity, based on their approach to: </p>
        <ul class="mb-2">
            <li>WAN Infrastructure, addressing usage and strategy with regards to connectivity and SD-WAN</li>
            <li>WAN Intelligence, covering usage of data and analytics to improve the performance of networks and applications</li>
            <li>WAN Operations, focusing on operational tasks such as configuration and security policy management</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-2">Based on your responses, this report provides you with a benchmark of your organization\'s WAN. It gives essential and tailored guidance to help you prepare for the requirements of tomorrow and plot your course to a Next-Generation WAN: a network that delivers the scalability, flexibility, manageability, cost-effectiveness, and security that your organization needs to drive digital transformation. </p>

            Figure 1 shows that IDC classes 16% of organizations as WAN Leader. These organizations typically differentiate themselves from others with their strategic approach toward the WAN, and a widespread usage of intelligence and automation. 41% of organizations are WAN Generalists, while 43% are considered as WAN Followers.

            Organizations can only reap the full benefits of digital transformation if this goes hand in hand with an evolution of their WAN. IDC has created the Next-Generation WAN Advisor to help organizations assess the readiness of their WAN for the digital future. It scores organizations on their approach to  WAN infrastructure, intelligence and operations. Based on a survey of 300 network influencers and decision makers we class organizations into three levels of maturity: Followers, Generalists, and Leaders.

Your network rapidly detects and responds to contain threats, which is essential in protecting your organization\'s assets. This positions you among the more advanced WAN Generalists in this space. Solutions that combine predictive analytics and automation to automatically reconfigure policies could take your security to the next level.

            Security plays a critical role in WAN strategy and operations. It is seen as the #1 WAN challenge and the vast majority of companies indicate they are improving network security in response to accelerating requirements. This makes managing security an increasingly important part of WAN operations. Unlike most WAN Generalists your security policy management is state-of-the-art, as it automatically reconfigures to prevent emerging threats with predictive analytics. While there is scope to investigate how security can be integrated more closely with the rest of your WAN management, you may want to focus on improving other WAN elements with a weaker ranking first.

It is seen as the #1 WAN challenge and the vast majority of companies indicate they are improving network security in response to accelerating requirements. This makes managing security an increasingly important part of WAN operations. You are far behind other WAN Leaders in this aspect, as you still manage your WAN security policy on a device by device basis, which can be quite a strain on your resources.  You will need to take action now to bring this aspect more in line with your overall WAN raking. A more centralized and automated approach should allow you to drive efficiency and consistency, speed up update cycles, and reduce risk.

It is seen as the #1 WAN challenge and the vast majority of companies indicate they are improving network security in response to accelerating requirements. This makes managing security an increasingly important part of WAN operations. You have centralized access policy and controls, but manual tasks can be quite a strain on your resources, while longer response times to threats can leave your WAN exposed. This positions you well behind other WAN Leaders. To  catch up with them you will need to start doing this in a more automated and dynamic manner. This will drive your efficiency and consistency, speed up update cycles, and reduce risk.

                Digital transformation, with cloud at its heart, is changing the networking paradigm and driving requirements to unprecedented heights. The WAN needs to change to cope with these requirements and enable organizations to reap the full benefits of digital transformation. Organizations will need networks that provide more flexibility, manageability, scalability, cost-effectiveness and security.

                    You should focus on further developing a strategic roadmap for the evolution of your WAN. Assess the current status of your network, and where you want it to be in the future. Prepare a gradual migration path that leverages the existing infrastructure where possible. Hybrid architectures, cloud connectivity, local Internet break-outs and network virtualization should feature prominently on this roadmap.

                    From an operational perspective the WAN is increasingly hampered by complexity, inefficiency and tedious processes which can make everyday tasks such as adding sites, updating policies or connecting to cloud services a real struggle. This prevents the network from delivering the desired business outcomes, like gaining agility, increasing productivity, and improving differentiation. Explore how centralization and automation can help you streamline your WAN operations.
