        <h2 class="text-dassault-blue mb-4">INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Digital fitness is critical for the success of start-ups and SMBs today. Competing in the global economy for customers, investment and talent requires instant access to world-class applications and IT resources, that scale at the pace of your success. The cloud delivers this the flexibility and scale that underpins digital business success and democratises access to world-class technology, making it available and affordable for startups and SMBs alike. To assess the digital fitness of startups and SMBS, IDC has conducted a survey of 400 organisations across Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S to understand how digital design and engineering applications are used in startup and SMB organisations. Based on the results, we have grouped the respondents into three categories, digital improver, digital achiever and digital native, to understand what sets the leaders in digital fitness apart from their competitors and which best practices we can learn from them.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-dassault-blue mb-4">SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The key priorities for the leading start-ups and SMBs according to the survey are related to profitability. They want to either improve profitability or become profitable, depending on the organization\'s age and stage of development. Managing profitability requires a careful balance between making the necessary investments to drive innovation and keeping costs from spiralling out of control. Aligning business and IT priorities and supporting the business strategy with a flexible IT delivery model supports the journey towards profitability. Additional priorities are increasing brand awareness and accelerating time to market. Using the latest IT applications and tools helps attract talent and create a great experience for employees, customers and partners, which in turn helps to improve brand awareness. Accelerating time to market is typically done by working with agile methods, in short sprints and by getting feedback from the market fast. A cloud-based digital platform can facilitate collaboration across geographically dispersed employees but also across the ecosystem of customer, partners and suppliers. </p>

        <h2 class="text-dassault-blue mb-4">RANKING EXPLANATION</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Based on the benchmark survey, 14.5% of respondents are digital natives, 50.5% of respondents are digital achievers and 35% of respondents are digital improvers. This distribution varies within the three categories of digital business, digital design and digital delivery, which make up the digital fitness index. Digital design is the most mature category, with 22% of respondents receiving a top score, while only 12.5% of respondents are top scorers in the digital business category, where dealing with changes in business patterns and staffing levels drive great challenges. Organizations who are better able to deal with fluctuations in business demand and staffing levels are scoring higher than organizations who are relying on rigid IT practices and hence cannot respond in an agile fashion to changing demands. The key to digital fitness is the ability to create great experiences for employees, customers and ecoystem partners through the use of digital technologies. The better an organization is equipped to do this, the better they score in the digital fitness index. </p>

            Startups and SMBs can only successfully compete in the global economy if they are digitally fit and take advantage of the digital technologies like digital design and engineering apps delivered from the cloud. IDC\'s Digital Fitness Assessment Tool scores startups and SMBs on their digital fitness by looking at three core elements - digital business, digital design and digital delivery.

                    Digital Delivery is about the alignment of IT with the business. Is IT seen as an enabler of digital business strategies or is it just considered a necessary cost? Has IT embraced modern delivery tools like cloud or is everything delivered manually and with internal assets and resources? Getting IT processes and delivery models right is critical to provide the agility and flexibility that start ups and SMBs require to react quickly to changing business patterns and staffing levels, as well creating great experiences for employees, customers and ecosystem partners.

Unfortunately, this perception usually leads to underinvestment in digital applications and IT infrastructure, which in turn creates a bad working experience for employees and leaves IT on the backfoot with regards to reacting to business requirements. To improve your digital delivery capabilities, create a proof of concept where you react fast to a business requirement and demonstrate that you can deliver digital innovation.

For example, if your staff levels are fluctuating significantly throughout the year, you can adjust the number of user licenses based on your actual staffing levels, which lets you react quickly to changes in the business without a huge upfront investment.

                Your senior management sees IT as a necessary evil that does not provide any significant value or differentiation. This puts you far behind your Digital Native peers. Unfortunately, this perception usually leads to underinvestment in digital applications and IT infrastructure, which in turn creates a bad working experience for employees and leaves IT on the backfoot with regards to reacting to business requirements. To improve your digital delivery capabilities, create a proof of concept where you react fast to a business requirement and demonstrate that you can deliver digital innovation. Moving to a cloud-based delivery model also changes the dynamics internally, as you move from a CAPEX to an OPEX model, where the operating cost is closely aligned with the changes in the business. For example, if your staff levels are fluctuating significantly throughout the year, you can adjust the number of user licenses based on your actual staffing levels, which lets you react quickly to changes in the business without a huge upfront investment.

This is the first step of digital transformation, where you use IT to improve your current business processes, but it is not real transformation. This puts you behind your Digital Native peers. If you want to demonstrate real transformation driven by IT, you need to support digital business innovation, through providing a modern platform for collaboration, both internally and with the external ecosystem.

                    You should focus on further developing a strategic roadmap for the evolution of your WAN. Assess the current status of your network, and where you want it to be in the future. Prepare a gradual migration path that leverages the existing infrastructure where possible. Hybrid architectures, cloud connectivity, local Internet break-outs and network virtualization should feature prominently on this roadmap.

                    From an operational perspective the WAN is increasingly hampered by complexity, inefficiency and tedious processes which can make everyday tasks such as adding sites, updating policies or connecting to cloud services a real struggle. This prevents the network from delivering the desired business outcomes, like gaining agility, increasing productivity, and improving differentiation. Explore how centralization and automation can help you streamline your WAN operations.
