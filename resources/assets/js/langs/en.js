As organizations implement digital transformation strategies they are faced with accelerating network requirements and the need for a network that supports the business outcomes they are aiming to achieve. Digital transformation should therefore go hand in hand with network evolution.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">IDC has developed the Next-Generation WAN Advisor to help organizations assess the state of their WAN, and benchmark this performance against their peers. This interactive self-assessment tool is backed up by independent end-user research and IDC's in-depth understanding of this market. The research draws upon input from 300 network experts and decision makers to understand how advanced different organizations are in terms of their WAN investment and approach.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">IDC has built a comparison framework in which individual responses from the survey are scored to group organizations into 3 levels of WAN maturity, based on their approach to: </p>\n        <ul class=\"mb-2\">\n            <li>WAN Infrastructure, addressing usage and strategy with regards to connectivity and SD-WAN</li>\n            <li>WAN Intelligence, covering usage of data and analytics to improve the performance of networks and applications</li>\n            <li>WAN Operations, focusing on operational tasks such as configuration and security policy management</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">Based on your responses, this report provides you with a benchmark of your organization's WAN. It gives essential and tailored guidance to help you prepare for the requirements of tomorrow and plot your course to a Next-Generation WAN: a network that delivers the scalability, flexibility, manageability, cost-effectiveness, and security that your organization needs to drive digital transformation. </p>\n\n        <h3 class=\"ntt-blue\">Figure 1 â€“ Next Generation WAN Assessment</h3>\n        <img src=\"{image}\" alt=\"\" class=\"block mx-auto mb-2\" />\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">\n            Figure 1 shows that IDC classes 16% of organizations as WAN Leader.

As organizations embrace digital transformation and adopt new practices such as cloud, SaaS, and IoT, it is very difficult to effectively secure their IT estate with a perimeter-based solution alone. Indeed, the sheer scale and changing nature of the threat environment mean that security breaches will happen â€” and this requires a new posture on security: one that is focused on near-real-time breach detection, containment, and mitigation.</p>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">Enterprise networks play a critical role in enabling this new security posture. New networking tools such as software-defined networking, microsegmentation, and advanced monitoring enable end-to-end visibility across the entire infrastructure and into the cloud. However, moving from an existing network state to an intelligent, secure-by-design network requires careful planning and execution.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">To help organizations assess their network maturity and benchmark against peers, IDC has developed the Secure-by-Design Network Advisor Tool. This interactive self-assessment tool is built on IDC's in-depth understanding of enterprise networking and security markets.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">The Secure-by-Design Network Advisor Tool uses a comparison framework which groups organizations into three levels of maturity, based on their approach to: </p>\n        <img src=\"{approach}\" style=\"width: 183.09mm; height{82}.9mm\" alt=\"\">\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">Based on your responses, this report provides an assessment of your organization's approach to secure-by-design networking. It also outlines essential and tailored guidance to help you plan and prepare for your network evolution. </p>        \n    ",
            "overallintro": "\n        <h2 class=\"text-vmware-blue mb-6\">YOUR RESULTS</h2>\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">\n            Organizations can only effectively secure their IT estate in the era of digital transformation if this goes hand in hand with an evolution of their network. IDC has created the Secure-by-Design Network Advisor Tool to help organizations assess the ability of their network to deliver security by design.

            "introduction": "\n        <h2 class=\"text-dassault-blue mb-4\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n        <p class=\"mb-6\">Digital maturity is critical for the success of start-ups and SMBs today. Competing in the global economy for customers, investment and talent requires instant access to world-class applications and IT resources, that scale at the pace of your success. The cloud delivers this the flexibility and scale that underpins digital business success and democratises access to world-class technology, making it available and affordable for startups and SMBs alike. To assess the digital maturity of startups and SMBS, IDC has conducted a survey of 400 organisations across Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S to understand how digital design and engineering applications are used in startup and SMB organisations. Based on the results, we have grouped the respondents into three categories, digital improver, digital achiever and digital native, to understand what sets the leaders in digital maturity apart from their competitors and which best practices we can learn from them.</p>\n        \n        <h2 class=\"text-dassault-blue mb-4\">SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS</h2>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">The key priorities for the leading start-ups and SMBs according to the survey are related to profitability. They want to either improve profitability or become profitable, depending on the organization's age and stage of development. Managing profitability requires a careful balance between making the necessary investments to drive innovation and keeping costs from spiralling out of control. Aligning business and IT priorities and supporting the business strategy with a flexible IT delivery model supports the journey towards profitability. Additional priorities are increasing brand awareness and accelerating time to market. Using the latest IT applications and tools helps attract talent and create a great experience for employees, customers and partners, which in turn helps to improve brand awareness. Accelerating time to market is typically done by working with agile methods, in short sprints and by getting feedback from the market fast. A cloud-based digital platform can facilitate collaboration across geographically dispersed employees but also across the ecosystem of customer, partners and suppliers. </p>\n\n        <h2 class=\"text-dassault-blue mb-4\">RANKING EXPLANATION</h2>\n        <div class=\"w-1/2 float-left\">\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">Based on the benchmark survey, <strong>14.5%</strong> of respondents are <strong>Digital Natives</strong>, <strong>50.5%</strong> of respondents are <strong>Digital Achievers</strong> and <strong>35%</strong> of respondents are <strong>Digital Improvers</strong>. This distribution varies within the three categories of digital business, digital design and digital delivery, which make up the digital maturity index. Digital design is the most mature category, with 22% of respondents receiving a top score, while only 12.5% of respondents are top scorers in the digital business category, where dealing with changes in business patterns and staffing levels drive great challenges. Organizations who are better able to deal with fluctuations in business demand and staffing levels are scoring higher than organizations who are relying on rigid IT practices and hence cannot respond in an agile fashion to changing demands. The key to digital maturity is the ability to create great experiences for employees, customers and ecoystem partners through the use of digital technologies. The better an organization is equipped to do this, the better they score in the digital maturity index. </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"w-1/2 float-left\">\n            <div class=\"m-2\"><img src=\"{rankimg}\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"pb clearfix\"></div>\n        <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n        \n    ",

However, the business case in the cloud does not stack up if you are not also changing your processes so that you scale your application usage up and down according to demand. In addition, cloud as an operating model provides so many other benefits like access to innovative services and support of an agile working culture, which provide more significant advantages than \"only\" cost savings.

            "introduction": "\n        <h2 class=\"text-dassault-blue mb-4\">INTRODUCTION</h2>\n        <p class=\"mb-6\">Digital maturity is critical for the success of start-ups and SMBs today. Competing in the global economy for customers, investment and talent requires instant access to world-class applications and IT resources, that scale at the pace of your success. The cloud delivers this the flexibility and scale that underpins digital business success and democratises access to world-class technology, making it available and affordable for startups and SMBs alike. To assess the digital maturity of startups and SMBS, IDC has conducted a survey of 400 organisations across Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S to understand how digital design and engineering applications are used in startup and SMB organisations. Based on the results, we have grouped the respondents into three categories, digital improver, digital achiever and digital native, to understand what sets the leaders in digital maturity apart from their competitors and which best practices we can learn from them.</p>\n        \n        <h2 class=\"text-dassault-blue mb-4\">SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS</h2>\n        <p class=\"mb-4\">The key priorities for the leading start-ups and SMBs according to the survey are related to profitability. They want to either improve profitability or become profitable, depending on the organization's age and stage of development. Managing profitability requires a careful balance between making the necessary investments to drive innovation and keeping costs from spiralling out of control. Aligning business and IT priorities and supporting the business strategy with a flexible IT delivery model supports the journey towards profitability. Additional priorities are increasing brand awareness and accelerating time to market. Using the latest IT applications and tools helps attract talent and create a great experience for employees, customers and partners, which in turn helps to improve brand awareness. Accelerating time to market is typically done by working with agile methods, in short sprints and by getting feedback from the market fast. A cloud-based digital platform can facilitate collaboration across geographically dispersed employees but also across the ecosystem of customer, partners and suppliers. </p>\n\n        <h2 class=\"text-dassault-blue mb-4\">RANKING EXPLANATION</h2>\n        <div class=\"w-1/2 float-left\">\n            <p class=\"mb-4\">Based on the benchmark survey, <strong>14.5%</strong> of respondents are <strong>Digital Natives</strong>, <strong>50.5%</strong> of respondents are <strong>Digital Achievers</strong> and <strong>35%</strong> of respondents are <strong>Digital Improvers</strong>. This distribution varies within the three categories of digital business, digital design and digital delivery, which make up the digital maturity index. Digital design is the most mature category, with 22% of respondents receiving a top score, while only 12.5% of respondents are top scorers in the digital business category, where dealing with changes in business patterns and staffing levels drive great challenges. Organizations who are better able to deal with fluctuations in business demand and staffing levels are scoring higher than organizations who are relying on rigid IT practices and hence cannot respond in an agile fashion to changing demands. The key to digital maturity is the ability to create great experiences for employees, customers and ecoystem partners through the use of digital technologies. The better an organization is equipped to do this, the better they score in the digital maturity index. </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"w-1/2 float-left\">\n            <div class=\"m-2\"><img src=\"{rankimg}\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"pb clearfix\"></div>\n        <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n        \n    ",
