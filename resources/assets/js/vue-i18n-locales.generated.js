As organizations implement digital transformation strategies they are faced with accelerating network requirements and the need for a network that supports the business outcomes they are aiming to achieve. Digital transformation should therefore go hand in hand with network evolution.<\/p>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">IDC has developed the Next-Generation WAN Advisor to help organizations assess the state of their WAN, and benchmark this performance against their peers. This interactive self-assessment tool is backed up by independent end-user research and IDC's in-depth understanding of this market. The research draws upon input from 300 network experts and decision makers to understand how advanced different organizations are in terms of their WAN investment and approach.<\/p>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">IDC has built a comparison framework in which individual responses from the survey are scored to group organizations into 3 levels of WAN maturity, based on their approach to: <\/p>\n        <ul class=\"mb-2\">\n            <li>WAN Infrastructure, addressing usage and strategy with regards to connectivity and SD-WAN<\/li>\n            <li>WAN Intelligence, covering usage of data and analytics to improve the performance of networks and applications<\/li>\n            <li>WAN Operations, focusing on operational tasks such as configuration and security policy management<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">Based on your responses, this report provides you with a benchmark of your organization's WAN. It gives essential and tailored guidance to help you prepare for the requirements of tomorrow and plot your course to a Next-Generation WAN: a network that delivers the scalability, flexibility, manageability, cost-effectiveness, and security that your organization needs to drive digital transformation. <\/p>\n\n        <h3 class=\"ntt-blue\">Figure 1 – Next Generation WAN Assessment<\/h3>\n        <img src=\"{image}\" alt=\"\" class=\"block mx-auto mb-2\" \/>\n        <p class=\"mb-2\">\n            Figure 1 shows that IDC classes 16% of organizations as WAN Leader. These organizations typically differentiate themselves from others with their strategic approach toward the WAN, and a widespread usage of intelligence and automation. 41% of organizations are WAN Generalists, while 43% are considered as WAN Followers.\n        <\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"pb\"><\/div>\n        <div class=\"spacer\"><\/div>\n        \n    ",

As a result, fees are derived from referrals or from resale, and organizations are generally focused on project revenues, rather than longer-term recurring revenue streams. Organizations at this stage in their cloud strategy are yet to embrace a cloud future and as a result may struggle to generate profits in this area. There is no defined vision for cloud, but there is time to make this transition if key decision makers act now.",

Typically, this is not granular enough to account for different product lines or individual P&L, and is often unmanaged and untargeted. With measurement limited, there is little in the way of automation, whether it is process, methodology, or sale and delivery. While businesses at this stage of maturity are beginning to build cloud sales functions and cloud-based marketing, revenue still comes from resale of on-premise solutions. Despite this, recurring revenue growth is outpacing traditional business.",

Organizations are beginning to monitor and target cloud-based revenues separately from license and other revenues. Many are also creating reusable processes and beginning to automate key functions. Marketing efforts are showing signs of sophistication, yet many organizations still need to migrate away from traditional marketing approaches. Organizations at this stage are likely to have established a well-structured technology roadmap and have started investing in cloud infrastructure, tools, and management technology. ",

Typically, organizations at this stage of their maturity can execute across multiple cloud architectures and have identified areas of specialism.
